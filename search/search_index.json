I feel like I should have had an improved system of communication, and that I did not immerse myself in collaborative systems. Of course, there were a few setbacks such as the adaptation to the city, and the course\u2019s a very unusual structure. But these could have been dealt with to a greater extent if I had been more organized with my communication tools. Having said that, this term I am hoping to dive into a greater amount of projects, to expand my ideas, and also increase my opportunities for collaboration with local communities. I am also making sure to record everything that I do, whereas last term I lacked pictures and in-depth reflections. Having said that, here are the projects that I will be working on this following term: Potential Collaborative Interventions \u00b6 \u201cDrugs? You Better Know\u201d This is a project where we are exploring the information widely available to the public on illegal drugs. Trying to intervene with the drug-saturated social culture of Barcelona, Claudia and Myself are designing a campaign to inform the public on which drugs are best to mix, which are not, what are the recommended doses, etc. What we hope to do here, is to tap into the somewhat banal taboo of recreational substance usage. Kombucha leather/Fish skin leather This is a Project in its early stages, where Marielle and I are looking to develop sustainable leather-like materials from two Kombucha Scobys and Fish Skin. Leather has widespread ecological implications, from animal abuse to toxic leather tinting. In contrast, we are here looking into developing sustainable alternatives to the material, taking into consideration these two materials as cultural practices (Asian and indigenous). Athletics, Smart Fabrics & AR Dhriti and I are currently discussing if we should collaborate on a project involving athletic technologies. The project would focus on the interplay between AR, smart textiles, and wearable technologies to improve athletic performance. Mycelium and the collective consciousness of non-human beings Taking on a conceptual stance, Stella and I are looking into the idea of consciousness in non-human beings, such as Fungi. Touching on both spirituality and solar punk systems, we are hoping to dig deeper into the conscious networks of mycelium so at to gain an innovative perspective on human consciousness and interspecies collaborations. Augmented Creativity and methodologies for the non-human This collective intervention was completed last term. Here, we attempted to create a design methodology for altered states. We used sensory tools such as tea, breathwork, and guided haiku poetry, in an attempt to facilitate a transition into \u201cnon-human-like\u201d states of consciousness. At the present moment, two methodology prototypes were performed, where we learned a lot about what it means to facilitate an experiment which taps into subject consciousness, and how to best record such results. As a group, we are still discussing whether we will continue to develop our experiment prototype. Personal Explorations \u00b6 AR & VR I spent my Christmas holidays learning how to code AR. I am still unsure of how I could use such technologies to its maximum potential, yet for now, I am interested in making alive that which is invisible. After reading \u201cFuturos Ancestrais\u201d by Ailton Krenak, I became intrigued by our notions of civil sanitation in the war against nature. My first experiment, then, is to create an AR experience that fills our environments with non-human biological beings, be those animals, trees, fungi, etc. Chitosan + Coffee Leather Here, as I was reading about biomaterials and their extents, I became particularly interested in Chitosan and Coffee leather and its aesthetics. I am then hoping to collaborate with Itnig for the coffee, and do some experimentation with the development of this material.","title":"Initial ideas"},{"location":"project/project/#term-1-reflection","text":"","title":"Term 1 Reflection"},{"location":"project/project/#personal-reflection","text":"Term 1, personally, was very confusing.

Maintaining the common theme of sustainability, both Nuria and Johnathan spoke of matters involving circular biological systems, DIY experiments, and self-sufficient agro practices which all converged to highlight the subject of what Jonathan described as \u201cmeta-design\u201d, thus the system within systems. This week\u2019s intellectual and practical exercises thus brought within themselves the insistence of rethinking current systems and using action as a vehicle for change. When I began this week\u2019s reflection, Interested in the practical experiment of developing bioplastics, alongside the genetic modification of microorganisms and our visit to the MATERFAD, I first looked into articles pertaining to \u2018plastic-eating\u2019 organisms as a vehicle for decomposing waste. That\u2019s when I ran into the Forbes article \u2018The race to develop plastic-eating bacteria\u2019 by Scott Carpenter. The article spoke of bacteria that are able to biodegrade PET plastic. Yet, \u201cIn order to make any of these naturally-occurring bacteria useful\u201d, meaning they would break down significant amounts of PET material, \u201cthey must be bioengineered to degrade plastic hundreds or thousands of times faster\u201d. This is explained to have ethical concerns related to the genetic modification of naturally-occurring beings, and also potentially hazardous effects for microbiomes in general. Nonetheless, the overarching issue is that even with such biotechnologies, these processes of biodegrading waste would not matter if societies are unable to properly recycle material, and differentiate our waste between recyclable and non-recyclable plastics. On a different note, Jonathan referred to Fukuoka\u2019s \u201cone-staw revolution\u201d when speaking of agricultural self-sufficiency and maintenance practices. According to \u2018The Philosophy of Masanobu Fukuoka\u2019, an article published by the Permaculture News, Fukuoka preaches against active intervention in biological rhythms. According to the article, \u201cRather than attempting to solve \u2018problems\u2019 through actions \u2013 new interventions to \u2018fix\u2019 things \u2013 he began to adopt a more \u2018subtractive\u2019 approach\u201d. In this case, he sought to substitute action for inaction. Yet, to what extent is that an optimal solution for the degradation of toxic waste? Rob from MATFAD spoke of mushroom species that have evolved towards \u201cplastic bioremediation properties\u201d. Hereby we can see how it is important to diverge from the common deceiving narrative of sustainable practices, and no \u201cone size fits all\u201d measure to our ever-growing rate of consumption and consequential waste production.","title":"Bio & Agri Zero"},{"location":"term1/05-LivingWithIdeas/","text":"Living With Your Own Ideas \u00b6 1 st Person Intervention on Virtual Fashion Systems \u00b6 What did you make and why did it matter? In an attempt to deepen my understanding of brand identities and emotional materialism, my intervention involved the act of purchasing and dressing a garment virtually. I wanted to understand both the feasibility and emotional repercussions of trying on clothing digitally. This served as an experiment to reflect on the context of \u201cmetaverse\u201d identities and digital embodiment. I also wanted to depict what it would feel like to try clothing virtually for physical purchases, speculating about the idea of distribution in accordance with demand, versus the current paradigm of demand based on supply. This matters because we are undoubtedly riding a wave toward digital materialism, and it is important to break down what that means for future societies and how we can dive into this transition as sustainably as possible. What happens when you involve yourself? What I realized, is that when you involve yourself in an experiment taking a first person perspective, you move beyond the speculative. The experience that one will acquire from an autoethnography is personal, yet nonetheless valid. It created questions that I probably would not have asked if I had looked at the issue through an observer perspective. Did anything change about the way you were working? Yes, everything. In the first place, I realized how much this project was related to aesthetics over anything else. For example, my initial idea was to digitally fabricate the North Face jacket. After a few hours of work, and not much improvement, I decided to use the ready-made .obj file on my avatar render. I\u2019ve wanted a warm puffer jacket for a while, and it might have made sense to own one virtually. That\u2019s when I realized I actually wanted the product for its physical components: warmth. While the experience of dressing anything was in fact intriguing, I missed the tactile features of trying out tangible materials, where I take into account touch and weight. In order to understand to a deeper extent what that meant, I decided to download another garment; a Balenciaga-inspired blazer. I actually enjoyed virtually dressing this garment more than the first one. I thought it looked aesthetic; I wanted to play with it and make my own version of it. This also made me reflect on brand identities and how virtual fashion experiences reflect high-end fashion consumerism in the sense that they are both deeply related to aesthetics. In this case, it seems that how one feels depends on how one looks, and not in fact on the materials involved. I then wonder, what might this mean for VR acquisitions? Can we in fact use virtual components to aid tangible distribution practices?

I have never had any experience with hands on machine engineering, meaning that prototyping a \u201calmost useless machine\u201d was very challenging in the sense that I had to adopt a learn-as-you-go methodology. With very little experience in coding, and an academic notion of design, it was imperative that I let go of determined hopes for the final product, trying to guide the machine and its functionaliites rather than set a finite and absolute expectation for what it could and would do. This shift in way of designing was a challenge at both a personal and group level. This is because all of our members had different expectations according to their personal skills sets, be it mechanical engineering, coding, design or project management. Nonetheless, the obstacles we encountered along the way were themselves lessons which redesigned our critical design processes. Accomplishments Our final prototype turned out very different than our initial proposal, yet through experimentation with Arduino and our machinery, we believe to have come up with something more creative and interactive than expected. We were able to collaborate and reiterate on new ideas whenever we encountered drawbacks with our prototype. Every obstacle, as frustrating as they were, guided us towards a different way of designing. This meant looking at our initial objectives with different lenses, and letting go of stubborn expectations for what our prototype was \u201cmeant\u201d to accomplish. Even though the final product of the \u201cdistracted timer\u201d did not \u201cwork\u201d until the last minute, where we encountered issues with coding, misdiagnosis of mechanical processes, and aesthetic drawbacks, I I believe the process to have been a success. Our true accomplishment was to have re-framed our conception of design, where we worked with the technologies available, rather than having them work for us. Failures/Challenges What hindered our project, none-the-less, was our stubbornness related to our traditional conception of design.

I have never had any experience with hands on machine engineering, meaning that prototyping a \u201calmost useless machine\u201d was very challenging in the sense that I had to adopt a learn-as-you-go methodology. With very little experience in coding, and an academic notion of design, it was imperative that I let go of determined hopes for the final product, trying to guide the machine and its functionaliites rather than set a finite and absolute expectation for what it could and would do. This shift in way of designing was a challenge at both a personal and group level. This is because all of our members had different expectations according to their personal skills sets, be it mechanical engineering, coding, design or project management. Nonetheless, the obstacles we encountered along the way were themselves lessons which redesigned our critical design processes. Accomplishments Our final prototype turned out very different than our initial proposal, yet through experimentation with Arduino and our machinery, we believe to have come up with something more creative and interactive than expected. We were able to collaborate and reiterate on new ideas whenever we encountered drawbacks with our prototype. Every obstacle, as frustrating as they were, guided us towards a different way of designing. This meant looking at our initial objectives with different lenses, and letting go of stubborn expectations for what our prototype was \u201cmeant\u201d to accomplish. Even though the final product of the \u201cdistracted timer\u201d did not \u201cwork\u201d until the last minute, where we encountered issues with coding, misdiagnosis of mechanical processes, and aesthetic drawbacks, I I believe the process to have been a success. Our true accomplishment was to have re-framed our conception of design, where we worked with the technologies available, rather than having them work for us.

From smartphones and social media to virtual reality and artificial intelligence, we are surrounded by powerful tools that allow us to create new worlds and experiences. Nonetheless, it must not be forgotten that such power comes with a great responsibility to use it in ways that benefit society and the environment. In this essay, we explore how modern literature poses different frameworks to design for equitable futures. In turn, hereby we will evaluate which worlds we can design with today\u2019s tools, how we can design the transition toward these worlds, and how design knowledge is evolving alongside the rise of Artificial Intelligence. In \u201cDesign as Participation\u201d, Kevin Slavin presents a radical departure from traditional design practices that have long been characterized by a top-down approach. According to Slavin, design should be viewed as a collaborative process. This participatory approach represents a significant shift in thinking, which acknowledges that design is not just about creating products or services but is also about creating the conditions for people to live enriched lives. By involving people in the design process, we can create solutions that are more relevant, effective, and sustainable. As stated by the author, a participatory approach to design thus ensures that people\u2019s needs and desires are taken into account, making the solutions more relevant and effective. It also ensures that the solutions are more sustainable, as people are more likely to adopt and maintain solutions they have helped to create. Furthermore, it promotes a sense of ownership and empowerment among the users, as they feel more invested in the solutions they have helped to create. Overall, a participatory approach to design promotes solutions that are effective, sustainable, and relevant to the people who use them. When speaking of collaborative design, we must not hesitate to ask the question: who are we collaborating with today in today\u2019s scenario? Even as we collaborate as humans within ourselves, it must not be ignored how communication today is more often than not mediated by technological platforms. Having said that, participatory approaches to design should not exclude participation with non-human parties such as Artificial Intelligence. AI and mass communication can play a significant role in implementing the participatory approach to design that Slavin advocates for. These sources of synthetic knowledge can help to analyze large amounts of data and provide insights into user needs and preferences, enabling designers to create more relevant and effective solutions. Additionally, AI-powered tools can facilitate collaboration and communication between designers and users, allowing for a more participatory design process. AI and mass communication technologies can thus play a significant role in implementing the participatory approach to design that Slavin advocates for. On a more pessimistic note, as evidence to Slavin\u2019s optimal framework for design, Patel and Moore highlight how our current non-collaborative systems serve to feed for deteriorative futures. The authors bring to light the consequences of the modern capitalist system that has emerged from the exploitation of cheap nature, money, work, care, food, energy, and lives. They argue that the current system, based on the exploitation of these cheap things, has resulted in a multitude of crises such as climate change, mass extinction of species, and unprecedented levels of inequality. The authors continuously point out that this is not only morally wrong but also unsustainable in the long run. The call for a radical shift in our values and priorities is necessary if we are to create a more sustainable and equitable world for all. This requires a comprehensive rethinking of our economic and political systems, as well as a collective effort to address the social and environmental challenges facing humanity. The piece hence serves as a reminder that we must consider the long-term consequences of our actions, and that the pursuit of short-term gains should not come at the cost of our planet and its inhabitants. Having said that, while developing technologies have the potential to aid global collaboration for diverse and equitable futures, we must not help but question to what extent Artificial Intelligence and digital communication platforms might not be just another one of these \u201ccheap things\u201d. For example, while Artificial Intelligence such as ChatGPT provide convenient and cost-free sources of information, we must not ignore that AI systems can perpetuate and even amplify existing biases and discrimination, particularly if they are trained on biased data or developed without adequate oversight and ethical guidelines. This can lead to unfair treatment of certain groups, reinforce stereotypes, and contribute to social inequalities. AI technologies can also pose significant risks to individual privacy and security, particularly if they are used for surveillance or data mining. Here we must pose the question, how are these short-term digital interactions molding our futures? What kinds of data are we donating, and how will these be used? While Artificial Intelligence and digital communication platforms could be used as tools for collaborative interventions, we must not ignore that such mediums for our intra-species communications are important and prevalent sources of synthetic knowledge. In turn, we must continuously question who owes the power to create and disseminate this synthesized information in order to ensure that these are used for positive long-term changes, rather than short-term convenience in exchange for lucrative monopolies of information. Dr. Frederick van Amstel\u2019s work on design and oppression is also relevant to this discussion. He argues that design decisions are often made by people in positions of power and that these decisions can have a significant impact on marginalized communities. Similarly, the design of automated communication technologies can perpetuate biases and discrimination if it is not done with a diverse group of people in mind. Amstel\u2019s work thus suggests that the kind of worlds we design must be conscious of the power dynamics at play and must strive to be inclusive and equitable. On a more positive perspective, Gregory Bateson\u2019s \u201cSteps to an Ecology of Mind\u201d emphasizes the interconnectedness of everything and calls for a holistic understanding of the world according to different systems of knowledge. The implications of this view go far beyond the natural world and apply to human-made systems such as technology, economics, and politics. In this light, the ecological approach can inform the design of systems that are better aligned with the natural world and that foster more sustainable and harmonious relationships between humans and the environment. According to Bateson, this shift toward an ecological approach to design can help us overcome the limitations of the reductionist and mechanistic approaches that have dominated design thinking for centuries. Bateson\u2019s ideas offer a valuable framework for understanding and addressing complex problems taking a systemic and interdependent approach to design solutions. When viewed through an ecological lens, the exponential growth of communication technologies and Artificial Intelligence can be seen as a valuable component in shaping the ecology of Futures. AI has the potential to improve decision-making processes, enhance our understanding of complex systems, and create opportunities for sustainable development. This, in turn, can allow us to dedicate more time and resources toward creative ideation for more equitable futures. Having said that, as we develop AI, it is imperative that we continuously re-evaluate its potential impact on social, economic, and environmental systems, and take a multidisciplinary approach that involves collaboration between scientists, engineers, social scientists, policymakers, and stakeholders. By doing so, we can ensure that AI is designed and utilized in ways that align with ecological principles and foster sustainable and equitable outcomes. Additionally, taking an ecological approach to AI design can help us address the ethical implications of its prevalent technologies, where we must observe what outcomes are being autonomously created so as to guide such dissemination of information in an equitable direction. Nonetheless, it is difficult to pinpoint whether Artificial Intelligence will aid in collaborative practices, or surrender as cheap solutions for short-term problems. Could it be that there is no definite answer to such a dilemma? \u201cThe Dawn of Everything\u201d by David Graeber and David Wengrow provides a historical perspective on human societies and their relationship with technology. The authors challenge the idea of linear progress and demonstrate that many societies in the past were highly innovative and sophisticated in their use of technology. This history suggests that the kind of worlds we design should not be based on the assumption of progress, but rather on recognizing that there have been and continue to be many different ways of living and organizing societies. Graeber and Wengrow\u2019s historical perspective on human societies raises important questions about the assumptions underlying the development and implementation of these technologies. One key question is whether AI development is driven solely by the goal of progress and efficiency, or whether it takes into account the diverse range of human societies and their unique needs and values. Additionally, the historical perspective on technology highlights the importance of considering the social and ethical implications of AI development and deployment. For example, the potential impact of AI on employment and labor markets raises questions about how we can design AI systems that prioritize human well-being and social equity. Overall, Graeber and Wengros\u2019s work highlights the importance of recognizing the diversity of human experience and designing AI systems that reflect this diversity, prioritizing social and ethical considerations. In conclusion, technology has great power to design and shape the world around us, but such revolutionary algorithmic force must be used responsibly in ways that cater to collective Futures. The participatory approach to design, advocated by Kevin Slavin, can help create solutions that are effective, sustainable, and relevant to the people who use them. I believe that this approach should not exclude participation with non-human parties such as Artificial Intelligence. We must not harden the association between technological advancement and progress per se. In contrast, we must accept these tools as new elements of our existing environments, and use them consciously in order to ensure that these new technologies will produce equitable outcomes for our collective Futures.

From smartphones and social media to virtual reality and artificial intelligence, we are surrounded by powerful tools that allow us to create new worlds and experiences. Nonetheless, it must not be forgotten that such power comes with a great responsibility to use it in ways that benefit society and the environment. In this essay, we explore how modern literature poses different frameworks to design for equitable futures. In turn, hereby we will evaluate which worlds we can design with today\u2019s tools, how we can design the transition toward these worlds, and how design knowledge is evolving alongside the rise of Artificial Intelligence. In \u201cDesign as Participation\u201d, Kevin Slavin presents a radical departure from traditional design practices that have long been characterized by a top-down approach. According to Slavin, design should be viewed as a collaborative process. This participatory approach represents a significant shift in thinking, which acknowledges that design is not just about creating products or services but is also about creating the conditions for people to live enriched lives. By involving people in the design process, we can create solutions that are more relevant, effective, and sustainable. As stated by the author, a participatory approach to design thus ensures that people\u2019s needs and desires are taken into account, making the solutions more relevant and effective. It also ensures that the solutions are more sustainable, as people are more likely to adopt and maintain solutions they have helped to create. Furthermore, it promotes a sense of ownership and empowerment among the users, as they feel more invested in the solutions they have helped to create. Overall, a participatory approach to design promotes solutions that are effective, sustainable, and relevant to the people who use them. When speaking of collaborative design, we must not hesitate to ask the question: who are we collaborating with today in today\u2019s scenario? Even as we collaborate as humans within ourselves, it must not be ignored how communication today is more often than not mediated by technological platforms. Having said that, participatory approaches to design should not exclude participation with non-human parties such as Artificial Intelligence. AI and mass communication can play a significant role in implementing the participatory approach to design that Slavin advocates for. These sources of synthetic knowledge can help to analyze large amounts of data and provide insights into user needs and preferences, enabling designers to create more relevant and effective solutions. Additionally, AI-powered tools can facilitate collaboration and communication between designers and users, allowing for a more participatory design process. AI and mass communication technologies can thus play a significant role in implementing the participatory approach to design that Slavin advocates for. On a more pessimistic note, as evidence to Slavin\u2019s optimal framework for design, Patel and Moore highlight how our current non-collaborative systems serve to feed for deteriorative futures. The authors bring to light the consequences of the modern capitalist system that has emerged from the exploitation of cheap nature, money, work, care, food, energy, and lives. They argue that the current system, based on the exploitation of these cheap things, has resulted in a multitude of crises such as climate change, mass extinction of species, and unprecedented levels of inequality. The authors continuously point out that this is not only morally wrong but also unsustainable in the long run. The call for a radical shift in our values and priorities is necessary if we are to create a more sustainable and equitable world for all. This requires a comprehensive rethinking of our economic and political systems, as well as a collective effort to address the social and environmental challenges facing humanity. The piece hence serves as a reminder that we must consider the long-term consequences of our actions, and that the pursuit of short-term gains should not come at the cost of our planet and its inhabitants. Having said that, while developing technologies have the potential to aid global collaboration for diverse and equitable futures, we must not help but question to what extent Artificial Intelligence and digital communication platforms might not be just another one of these \u201ccheap things\u201d. For example, while Artificial Intelligence such as ChatGPT provide convenient and cost-free sources of information, we must not ignore that AI systems can perpetuate and even amplify existing biases and discrimination, particularly if they are trained on biased data or developed without adequate oversight and ethical guidelines. This can lead to unfair treatment of certain groups, reinforce stereotypes, and contribute to social inequalities. AI technologies can also pose significant risks to individual privacy and security, particularly if they are used for surveillance or data mining. Here we must pose the question, how are these short-term digital interactions molding our futures? What kinds of data are we donating, and how will these be used? While Artificial Intelligence and digital communication platforms could be used as tools for collaborative interventions, we must not ignore that such mediums for our intra-species communications are important and prevalent sources of synthetic knowledge. In turn, we must continuously question who owes the power to create and disseminate this synthesized information in order to ensure that these are used for positive long-term changes, rather than short-term convenience in exchange for lucrative monopolies of information. Dr. Frederick van Amstel\u2019s work on design and oppression is also relevant to this discussion. He argues that design decisions are often made by people in positions of power and that these decisions can have a significant impact on marginalized communities. Similarly, the design of automated communication technologies can perpetuate biases and discrimination if it is not done with a diverse group of people in mind. Amstel\u2019s work thus suggests that the kind of worlds we design must be conscious of the power dynamics at play and must strive to be inclusive and equitable. On a more positive perspective, Gregory Bateson\u2019s \u201cSteps to an Ecology of Mind\u201d emphasizes the interconnectedness of everything and calls for a holistic understanding of the world according to different systems of knowledge. The implications of this view go far beyond the natural world and apply to human-made systems such as technology, economics, and politics. In this light, the ecological approach can inform the design of systems that are better aligned with the natural world and that foster more sustainable and harmonious relationships between humans and the environment. According to Bateson, this shift toward an ecological approach to design can help us overcome the limitations of the reductionist and mechanistic approaches that have dominated design thinking for centuries. Bateson\u2019s ideas offer a valuable framework for understanding and addressing complex problems taking a systemic and interdependent approach to design solutions. When viewed through an ecological lens, the exponential growth of communication technologies and Artificial Intelligence can be seen as a valuable component in shaping the ecology of Futures. AI has the potential to improve decision-making processes, enhance our understanding of complex systems, and create opportunities for sustainable development. This, in turn, can allow us to dedicate more time and resources toward creative ideation for more equitable futures. Having said that, as we develop AI, it is imperative that we continuously re-evaluate its potential impact on social, economic, and environmental systems, and take a multidisciplinary approach that involves collaboration between scientists, engineers, social scientists, policymakers, and stakeholders. By doing so, we can ensure that AI is designed and utilized in ways that align with ecological principles and foster sustainable and equitable outcomes. Additionally, taking an ecological approach to AI design can help us address the ethical implications of its prevalent technologies, where we must observe what outcomes are being autonomously created so as to guide such dissemination of information in an equitable direction. Nonetheless, it is difficult to pinpoint whether Artificial Intelligence will aid in collaborative practices, or surrender as cheap solutions for short-term problems. Could it be that there is no definite answer to such a dilemma? \u201cThe Dawn of Everything\u201d by David Graeber and David Wengrow provides a historical perspective on human societies and their relationship with technology. The authors challenge the idea of linear progress and demonstrate that many societies in the past were highly innovative and sophisticated in their use of technology. This history suggests that the kind of worlds we design should not be based on the assumption of progress, but rather on recognizing that there have been and continue to be many different ways of living and organizing societies. Graeber and Wengrow\u2019s historical perspective on human societies raises important questions about the assumptions underlying the development and implementation of these technologies. One key question is whether AI development is driven solely by the goal of progress and efficiency, or whether it takes into account the diverse range of human societies and their unique needs and values. Additionally, the historical perspective on technology highlights the importance of considering the social and ethical implications of AI development and deployment. For example, the potential impact of AI on employment and labor markets raises questions about how we can design AI systems that prioritize human well-being and social equity. Overall, Graeber and Wengros\u2019s work highlights the importance of recognizing the diversity of human experience and designing AI systems that reflect this diversity, prioritizing social and ethical considerations. In conclusion, technology has great power to design and shape the world around us, but such revolutionary algorithmic force must be used responsibly in ways that cater to collective Futures. The participatory approach to design, advocated by Kevin Slavin, can help create solutions that are effective, sustainable, and relevant to the people who use them. I believe that this approach should not exclude participation with non-human parties such as Artificial Intelligence. We must not harden the association between technological advancement and progress per se. In contrast, we must accept these tools as new elements of our existing environments, and use them consciously in order to ensure that these new technologies will produce equitable outcomes for our collective Futures.

Personally, as someone who has never worked with electronics, it was difficult to grasp the practical uses of the theoretical knowledge presented. Nonetheless, I am exited for future projects, where I hope to truly understand the extents of electronic hardware and command-based electronics. Following, here is the class assignment: Arduino Code and Music. int buzzer = 13;//the pin of the active buzzer void setup() { pinMode(buzzer,OUTPUT);//initialize the buzzer pin as an output } void loop() { unsigned char i; while(1) { for(i=0;i<80;i++) { digitalWrite(buzzer,HIGH); delay(2);//wait for 1ms digitalWrite(buzzer,LOW); delay(1);//wait for 1ms } for(i=0;i<100;i++) { digitalWrite(buzzer,HIGH); delay(2);//wait for 2ms digitalWrite(buzzer,LOW); delay(2);//wait for 2ms } for(i=0;i<40;i++) { digitalWrite(buzzer,HIGH); delay(1);//wait for 2ms digitalWrite(buzzer,LOW); delay(2);//wait for 2ms } } } Computer Aided Modelling and Manifacturing \u00b6 Today was very interesting to me, since I am very intrigued by 3D modelling and its endless real of capabilities. I have previous experience with blender, and decided to explore it materiality tools. Following is what I was able to come up with when exploring with the generation of liquid: Also, here is my parametric drawing of a croissant: 2D Fabrication - Laser Cutting \u00b6 For the Laser Cut Project, we printed pieces of our intervention installation \u201cThe Confessional\u201d. Laser cutting, to me, was a complex experience when having to translate the lines in rhino to the machine itself. Nonetheless, to ease our process, we used the conventional parameters available at fablab for speed and power. Also, in order to waste a lesser amount of material when doing our project, we first prototyped. using cardboard, before cutting into our final piece on plywood. Inputs and Outputs - Morse Code Conversations \u00b6 This class we discussed the different types of sensors, how resistors work and affect the overall circuit, and the overall importance of inputs and outputs. This code represents the sensor readings and how it determines an output as SHORT or LONG as according to morse code outputs represented by another system of a Blinking LED light. The loop function reads the value of an analog sensor connected to the the Arduino board. If the sensor value is greater than 1000, it sends a message to the serial monitor to turn off the lights and waits for one second. If the sensor value is less than or equal to 1000, it sends a message to the serial monitor that the lights are off and checks if the LED has turned on by checking if the sensor value is greater than 100 and ledState is 0. If the LED has turned on, it sets ledState to 1 and sends a message to the serial monitor that the LED has turned on. It also sets the startTime variable to the current time using the millis() function and sends a message to the serial monitor with the start time. The program is trying to sense blinking lights as a translation of Morse code. Therefore, if the LED turns off again, the program calculates the duration of the LED being on by taking the difference between the start time and the end time using the millis() function. It then sends a message to the serial monitor with the end time and the interval. If the interval is less than 1000 milliseconds, it sends a message to the serial monitor that the interval is short, indicating a dot in Morse code. If the interval is greater than or equal to 1000 milliseconds, it sends a message to the serial monitor that the interval is long, indicating a dash in Morse code. int R2 = 10000; float VIN = 3.0; unsigned long startTime = 0; unsigned long endTime = 0; unsigned long interval = 0; int ledState = 0; void setup() { Serial.begin(9600); } void loop() { // read the input on analog pin 0: int sensorValue = analogRead(A3); if (sensorValue > 1000) { Serial.println(\"turn off the lights!\"); delay(1000); } else { Serial.println(\"lights off, checking for LED...\"); if (sensorValue > 100 && ledState == 0) //if the led turns on { ledState = 1; Serial.println(\"the led turned on, I think!\"); startTime = millis(); Serial.println(\"start time:\"); Serial.println(startTime); if (sensorValue < 100) { endTime = millis(); Serial.println(\"end time: \"); Serial.println(endTime); interval = endTime - startTime; Serial.println(\"interval: \"); Serial.println(interval); Serial.println(\"The LED is back off, I think!\"); ledState = 0; delay(1000); if (interval < 1000) { Serial.println(\"SHORT\"); delay(1000); interval = 0; } else { Serial.println(\"LONG\"); delay(1000); interval = 0; } } } // Convert the analog reading (which goes from 0 - 1023) to a voltage (0 - 5V): //float voltage = sensorValue * (3.0 / 1023.0); // Get the value of R1 //int ldr = ((R2 * VIN) / voltage) - R2; // print out the value you read: //Serial.println(sensorValue); //Serial.print(\"voltage: \"); //Serial.println(voltage); //Serial.print(\"LDR value: \"); //Serial.println(ldr); } } Challenge I - Augmented Reality and Hidden Conversations \u00b6 Repo: https://github.com/mdhelomme/MicroChallengeI Project Overview: Unfolding Conversations is an ongoing intervention that aims to create open dialogue surrounding the use of psychoactive substances in recreational environments. The project seeks to provide a non-judgmental platform for people to share their experiences and opinions on drug use in various locations, such as music festivals, bars, or universities. It combines a physical sharing board with augmented reality technology to create a unique and interactive experience that facilitates communication about a topic often considered taboo. Key Components: Sharing Board: The board is designed using a topography map to allow for modularity and adaptability to different locations and settings. It presents a flow of statements and questions related to drug use, and participants can engage with the board by attaching threads to nails corresponding to their answers. Invisible Answers: To encourage honest sharing, the project includes \u201cinvisible answers\u201d that can be revealed through an augmented reality (AR) app. These answers are printed on stickers with unique shapes and placed on the board. When scanned with the AR app, the stickers reveal more intimate and difficult statements that may be harder for participants to express openly. AR App: The app, developed using an AR development package and ARKit, allows participants to scan the stickers and view the hidden answers on their smartphones. Currently, the app is limited to individual deployment on iOS devices and must be built through Xcode. Project Breakdown: We designed the board starting with a topography map to give a modularity aspect and not to limitate ourselves to a squared board. Also, the shapes of the topography allow us to build on to different shapes and adjust the board according to our preference. Once the shapes were fixed we developed a flow of answers that could represent statements related to drugs and then we placed them in the rhino file. We first prototyped the board in cardboard to test it out and then laser-cut it on plywood. The whole board starts with a question: \u201cDo you do drugs?\u201d The YES and NO answers correspond to a thread and then the journey begins as a flow of answers to communicate personal opinions and experiences. Close to each answer, we put a nail where a thread can be attached as a \u201cyes I do\u201d. We know that being honest, with themselves and others, about drugs is not easy, so in order to allow people to feel more comfortable about sharing we came up with the idea of the invisible answers, more intimate and difficult statements that might be hard to point out in front of others. These answers were not laser cut in the board, instead, we printed shaped stickers (connected to the aesthetic of the project) on blue vinyl and then stuck them on the board. Utilizing an augmented reality development package along with ARKit, we developed an app that enables users to individually scan each icon (stickers), subsequently displaying the \u201cinvisible answers\u201d on their smartphones. However, the app is restricted to individual deployment, which requires us to build and deploy it on each iOS device via Xcode. As a result, the code is currently exclusive to iOS builds. Ultimately, each participant can experience an open and inclusive space for sharing even more intimate and private aspects related to drug use. This project is a component of a broader initiative called \u201cDrugs You Better Know,\u201d which will soon seek to participate in a Sonar open call for artistic and technological projects operating at the intersection of art, technology, science, and society, focusing on ideas that involve the development of AI, VR, and AR. By creating a safe space for sharing personal opinions and experiences about drug use, Unfolding Conversations hopes to raise awareness about the substances in circulation, foster informed decision-making, and ultimately reduce the risk of drug-related problems in recreational environments. Networking \u00b6 For this class we learned about the encryption of networks. During the process of establishing a wireless communication network utilizing Wifi broadcasting, we employed the ESP32 Feather development board as a key component. Our team utilized the Arduino serial monitor to input and exchange messages, allowing us to maintain seamless communication throughout the project. Once we successfully set up the system, we proceeded to connect four laptops within our classroom to the established Wifi network. Via the MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) protocol, we were able to facilitate efficient communication between the connected devices and the central broker. This ensured that the data being exchanged among the laptops was managed effectively and in a streamlined manner, further enhancing the overall functionality of our wireless communication system. 3D Printing and Scanning \u00b6 3D Printing was straight-forward, as was 3D Scanning. 3D Model & Printing For this project, I collaborated with Ramiro and Claudia to build a volcano ashtray: This was our attempt to replicate the 3D model: Printing was very simple. All we had to do was transfer the file to cura with the correct parameters, save the file on the mini sd card, and send it over to the FabLab pronter. 3D Scan of Printed Model Later on, we scanned it using our IPhone infrared sensor camera. Interfaces - Machines \u00b6 For this class, we used a remote server to simoultaneoulsy activate all the ESP Featherboards in class, resulting in a fun light show. It was very interesting to work with the remote network. The reference code provided in class allowed us to control the behavior of an LED connected to the Arduino microcontroller remotely through serial communication. By sending specific messages from the remote device, we could control the LED\u2019s blinking pattern, including the number of blinks and the speed of blinking. Overall, while I did not understand much of the specifics, the collaborative exercise was a fun way to superficially grasp the power of remote control. #include \"Arduino.h\" #define LED_PIN 14 // the setup function runs once when you press reset or power the board void setup() { // initialize digital pin LED_BUILTIN as an output. pinMode(LED_PIN, OUTPUT); Serial.begin(9600); } void blink () { digitalWrite(LED_PIN, HIGH); // turn the LED on (HIGH is the voltage level) delay(1000); // wait for a second digitalWrite(LED_PIN, LOW); // turn the LED off by making the voltage LOW delay(1000); // wait for a second } void blinkFast () { int i=0; while(i<20){ digitalWrite(LED_PIN, HIGH); // turn the LED on (HIGH is the voltage level) delay(100); // wait for a second digitalWrite(LED_PIN, LOW); // turn the LED off by making the voltage LOW delay(100); i++; } // wait for a second } void blinkX (int reps) { int i=0; while(i<reps){ digitalWrite(LED_PIN, HIGH); // turn the LED on (HIGH is the voltage level) delay(100); // wait for a second digitalWrite(LED_PIN, LOW); // turn the LED off by making the voltage LOW delay(100); i++; } // wait for a second } // the loop function runs over and over again forever void loop() { if (Serial.available()) { String newMsg = Serial.readString(); newMsg.trim(); Serial.print(\"Got new message!: \"); Serial.println(newMsg); // blink if we tell it to! if (newMsg.equals(\"a\")){ blink(); } if (newMsg.equals(\"c\")){ blink(); blink(); blink(); } if (newMsg.equals(\"b\")){ blink(); blink(); } if (newMsg.equals(\"fast\")){ blinkFast(); } if (newMsg.equals(\"b5\")){ blinkX(5); } if (newMsg.equals(\"b50\")){ blinkX(50); } } } CNC Machining \u00b6 CNC machining was harder than I expected it to be. The initial phase of our process involved utilizing Rhino render to gain an understanding of the measurements and proportions required for our design. As we progressed, we made significant alterations to the design in order to accommodate the available board size and ensure that the final structure would be as lightweight as possible. In the second stage, we transitioned our design file to be compatible with CNC configuration. This required converting the 3D model into a 2D representation, which would ultimately facilitate the fabrication process. Given that the walls of the confessional booth would need to be securely connected, we spent considerable time devising a finger tenon joinery system to achieve this goal. The third step of our project entailed familiarizing ourselves with the operation of the CNC machine so as ro comprehend the necessary settings and adjustments for the machine. This would theoretically ensure the accuracy and precision of our fabrication efforts. As we delved into the complexities of the process, we encountered numerous unforeseen details and considerations that had not been evident during the 3D modeling phase. This necessitated last-minute modifications and adjustments, which, though unexpected, ultimately demonstrated the importance of recording our processes and paying attention to detail.. Challenge 2 \u00b6 Repo: https://github.com/clodbe0/Microchallenge-II/edit/main/README.md For our microchallenge II we proposed was an interactive installation that allows people to share their experiences with psychoactive substances, and a virtual reality environment that reinforces such a dialogue. The confessional - an interactive installation: The lack of communication and dialogue around psychoactive substances often leads to a lack of awareness and information about the topic. We believe that sharing personal experiences can be a valuable tool in preventing harm to other consumers. To promote communication and comfortability, we have created The Confessional - a personal and protected space where individuals can freely and anonymously narrate their personal experiences with psychoactive substances. The Confessional is made of plywood, making it lightweight and portable. Ideally, all the stories shared in The Confessional will then be translated into a VR experience, which we aim to exhibit at Sonar+D. We recognize that the use of substances is both literary and personal, where one\u2019s experience is only partially narrated by literature on a substance and its effects. Therefore, we believe that personal conversations are essential when discussing the topic. Unfolding Conversation thus aims to provide a safe space for people to share their experiences, creating a database of personal narratives that will be exhibited in subsequent installations. Through the power of storytelling, we hope to promote understanding, reduce stigma and discrimination, and create a more accepting and open attitude towards psychoactive substance consumption, especially in a music fest environment where people might be keener to be involved in the topic, looking for further safety and comfort. Key Components: Structure: Pieces were modeled in Rhino and fabricated via laser cut and CNC (plywood). These technologies were facilitated by FabLab Barcelona. Directional Microphone: A directional microphone allowed us to minimize unwanted background noise or interference when recording personal experiences. This provides for minimal post-processing and cleaner audio data, increasing the animation precision of the audio2face animations. While we toyed with the idea of using external microphones and a Raspberry Pi, at the time of our presentation, it did not work. distance measurement code #Libraries import RPi.GPIO as GPIO import time #GPIO Mode (BOARD / BCM) GPIO.setmode(GPIO.BCM) #set GPIO Pins GPIO_TRIGGER = 18 GPIO_ECHO = 24 #set GPIO direction (IN / OUT) GPIO.setup(GPIO_TRIGGER, GPIO.OUT) GPIO.setup(GPIO_ECHO, GPIO.IN) def distance(): # set Trigger to HIGH GPIO.output(GPIO_TRIGGER, True) # set Trigger after 0.01ms to LOW time.sleep(0.00001) GPIO.output(GPIO_TRIGGER, False) StartTime = time.time() StopTime = time.time() # save StartTime while GPIO.input(GPIO_ECHO) == 0: StartTime = time.time() # save time of arrival while GPIO.input(GPIO_ECHO) == 1: StopTime = time.time() # time difference between start and arrival TimeElapsed = StopTime - StartTime # multiply with the sonic speed (34300 cm/s) # and divide by 2, because there and back distance = (TimeElapsed * 34300) / 2 return distance if __name__ == '__main__': try: while True: dist = distance() print (\"Measured Distance = %.1f cm\" % dist) if dist <= 35: print (\"we are in the area of interest\") time.sleep(1) Reset by pressing CTRL + C except KeyboardInterrupt: print(\"Measurement stopped by User\") GPIO.cleanup() Microphone code Import pyaudio import wave FORMAT = pyaudio.paInt16 CHANNELS = 1 RATE = 44100 CHUNK = 1024 RECORD_SECONDS = 5 WAVE_OUTPUT_FILENAME = \"file.wav\" audio = pyaudio.PyAudio() start Recording stream = audio.open(format=FORMAT, channels=CHANNELS, input_device_index = 1, rate=RATE, input=True, frames_per_buffer=CHUNK) print (\"recording...\") frames = [] for i in range(0, int(RATE / CHUNK * RECORD_SECONDS)): data = stream.read(CHUNK) frames.append(data) print (\"finished recording\") stop Recording stream.stop_stream() stream.close() audio.terminate() waveFile = wave.open(WAVE_OUTPUT_FILENAME, 'wb') waveFile.setnchannels(CHANNELS) waveFile.setsampwidth(audio.get_sample_size(FORMAT)) waveFile.setframerate(RATE) waveFile.writeframes(b''.join(frames)) waveFile.close() Final Reflection: Responsible for the physical aspect of the challenge, thus putting together the confessional, it did not take long for me to realize the importance of PLANNING AHEAD and making parametric designs. Many times, we had to measure drilling holes by hand, when we could have both laser cut and measured these virtually, saving us lots of time. Same happened when 3d modelling certain insertion pieces. Overall this challenge was very important for me to realize the importance of planning (almost) every detail before trying to physically piece things together.","title":"Prototyping for Design"},{"location":"term2/12-PrototypingForDesign/#prototyping-for-design","text":"","title":"Prototyping for Design"},{"location":"term2/12-PrototypingForDesign/#reflections","text":"","title":"Reflections"},{"location":"term2/12-PrototypingForDesign/#electronics-and-coding","text":"This class we explored the basics and extents of electronics.

It also sets the startTime variable to the current time using the millis() function and sends a message to the serial monitor with the start time. The program is trying to sense blinking lights as a translation of Morse code. Therefore, if the LED turns off again, the program calculates the duration of the LED being on by taking the difference between the start time and the end time using the millis() function. It then sends a message to the serial monitor with the end time and the interval. If the interval is less than 1000 milliseconds, it sends a message to the serial monitor that the interval is short, indicating a dot in Morse code. If the interval is greater than or equal to 1000 milliseconds, it sends a message to the serial monitor that the interval is long, indicating a dash in Morse code. int R2 = 10000; float VIN = 3.0; unsigned long startTime = 0; unsigned long endTime = 0; unsigned long interval = 0; int ledState = 0; void setup() { Serial.begin(9600); } void loop() { // read the input on analog pin 0: int sensorValue = analogRead(A3); if (sensorValue > 1000) { Serial.println(\"turn off the lights!\"); delay(1000); } else { Serial.println(\"lights off, checking for LED...\"); if (sensorValue > 100 && ledState == 0) //if the led turns on { ledState = 1; Serial.println(\"the led turned on, I think!\"); startTime = millis(); Serial.println(\"start time:\"); Serial.println(startTime); if (sensorValue < 100) { endTime = millis(); Serial.println(\"end time: \"); Serial.println(endTime); interval = endTime - startTime; Serial.println(\"interval: \"); Serial.println(interval); Serial.println(\"The LED is back off, I think!\"); ledState = 0; delay(1000); if (interval < 1000) { Serial.println(\"SHORT\"); delay(1000); interval = 0; } else { Serial.println(\"LONG\"); delay(1000); interval = 0; } } } // Convert the analog reading (which goes from 0 - 1023) to a voltage (0 - 5V): //float voltage = sensorValue * (3.0 / 1023.0); // Get the value of R1 //int ldr = ((R2 * VIN) / voltage) - R2; // print out the value you read: //Serial.println(sensorValue); //Serial.print(\"voltage: \"); //Serial.println(voltage); //Serial.print(\"LDR value: \"); //Serial.println(ldr); } }","title":"Inputs and Outputs - Morse Code Conversations"},{"location":"term2/12-PrototypingForDesign/#challenge-i-augmented-reality-and-hidden-conversations","text":"Repo: https://github.com/mdhelomme/MicroChallengeI Project Overview: Unfolding Conversations is an ongoing intervention that aims to create open dialogue surrounding the use of psychoactive substances in recreational environments. The project seeks to provide a non-judgmental platform for people to share their experiences and opinions on drug use in various locations, such as music festivals, bars, or universities. It combines a physical sharing board with augmented reality technology to create a unique and interactive experience that facilitates communication about a topic often considered taboo. Key Components: Sharing Board: The board is designed using a topography map to allow for modularity and adaptability to different locations and settings. It presents a flow of statements and questions related to drug use, and participants can engage with the board by attaching threads to nails corresponding to their answers. Invisible Answers: To encourage honest sharing, the project includes \u201cinvisible answers\u201d that can be revealed through an augmented reality (AR) app. These answers are printed on stickers with unique shapes and placed on the board. When scanned with the AR app, the stickers reveal more intimate and difficult statements that may be harder for participants to express openly. AR App: The app, developed using an AR development package and ARKit, allows participants to scan the stickers and view the hidden answers on their smartphones. Currently, the app is limited to individual deployment on iOS devices and must be built through Xcode. Project Breakdown: We designed the board starting with a topography map to give a modularity aspect and not to limitate ourselves to a squared board. Also, the shapes of the topography allow us to build on to different shapes and adjust the board according to our preference. Once the shapes were fixed we developed a flow of answers that could represent statements related to drugs and then we placed them in the rhino file. We first prototyped the board in cardboard to test it out and then laser-cut it on plywood. The whole board starts with a question: \u201cDo you do drugs?\u201d The YES and NO answers correspond to a thread and then the journey begins as a flow of answers to communicate personal opinions and experiences. Close to each answer, we put a nail where a thread can be attached as a \u201cyes I do\u201d. We know that being honest, with themselves and others, about drugs is not easy, so in order to allow people to feel more comfortable about sharing we came up with the idea of the invisible answers, more intimate and difficult statements that might be hard to point out in front of others. These answers were not laser cut in the board, instead, we printed shaped stickers (connected to the aesthetic of the project) on blue vinyl and then stuck them on the board. Utilizing an augmented reality development package along with ARKit, we developed an app that enables users to individually scan each icon (stickers), subsequently displaying the \u201cinvisible answers\u201d on their smartphones. However, the app is restricted to individual deployment, which requires us to build and deploy it on each iOS device via Xcode. As a result, the code is currently exclusive to iOS builds. Ultimately, each participant can experience an open and inclusive space for sharing even more intimate and private aspects related to drug use. This project is a component of a broader initiative called \u201cDrugs You Better Know,\u201d which will soon seek to participate in a Sonar open call for artistic and technological projects operating at the intersection of art, technology, science, and society, focusing on ideas that involve the development of AI, VR, and AR. By creating a safe space for sharing personal opinions and experiences about drug use, Unfolding Conversations hopes to raise awareness about the substances in circulation, foster informed decision-making, and ultimately reduce the risk of drug-related problems in recreational environments.","title":"Challenge I - Augmented Reality and Hidden Conversations"},{"location":"term2/12-PrototypingForDesign/#networking","text":"For this class we learned about the encryption of networks.

Once we successfully set up the system, we proceeded to connect four laptops within our classroom to the established Wifi network. Via the MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) protocol, we were able to facilitate efficient communication between the connected devices and the central broker.

By sending specific messages from the remote device, we could control the LED\u2019s blinking pattern, including the number of blinks and the speed of blinking.

The initial phase of our process involved utilizing Rhino render to gain an understanding of the measurements and proportions required for our design. As we progressed, we made significant alterations to the design in order to accommodate the available board size and ensure that the final structure would be as lightweight as possible. In the second stage, we transitioned our design file to be compatible with CNC configuration. This required converting the 3D model into a 2D representation, which would ultimately facilitate the fabrication process. Given that the walls of the confessional booth would need to be securely connected, we spent considerable time devising a finger tenon joinery system to achieve this goal. The third step of our project entailed familiarizing ourselves with the operation of the CNC machine so as ro comprehend the necessary settings and adjustments for the machine. This would theoretically ensure the accuracy and precision of our fabrication efforts. As we delved into the complexities of the process, we encountered numerous unforeseen details and considerations that had not been evident during the 3D modeling phase.

The confessional - an interactive installation: The lack of communication and dialogue around psychoactive substances often leads to a lack of awareness and information about the topic. We believe that sharing personal experiences can be a valuable tool in preventing harm to other consumers. To promote communication and comfortability, we have created The Confessional - a personal and protected space where individuals can freely and anonymously narrate their personal experiences with psychoactive substances. The Confessional is made of plywood, making it lightweight and portable. Ideally, all the stories shared in The Confessional will then be translated into a VR experience, which we aim to exhibit at Sonar+D. We recognize that the use of substances is both literary and personal, where one\u2019s experience is only partially narrated by literature on a substance and its effects. Therefore, we believe that personal conversations are essential when discussing the topic. Unfolding Conversation thus aims to provide a safe space for people to share their experiences, creating a database of personal narratives that will be exhibited in subsequent installations. Through the power of storytelling, we hope to promote understanding, reduce stigma and discrimination, and create a more accepting and open attitude towards psychoactive substance consumption, especially in a music fest environment where people might be keener to be involved in the topic, looking for further safety and comfort. Key Components: Structure: Pieces were modeled in Rhino and fabricated via laser cut and CNC (plywood). These technologies were facilitated by FabLab Barcelona. Directional Microphone: A directional microphone allowed us to minimize unwanted background noise or interference when recording personal experiences. This provides for minimal post-processing and cleaner audio data, increasing the animation precision of the audio2face animations.

In simpler words, it showed me what I had already accomplished and how could I move towards the next steps in direction of a positive impact. Dynamics: I really enjoyed my group\u2019s dynamics, particularly Korbi\u2019s reflections on the definitions of value and capital.

Values of exchange, in my opining, are in fact instrinsically tied to social-economic systems. While at first the \u2018value\u2019 section it seemed common-sensical to me, as I began to question its relationship to infrastructures Interactions: Very honestly my interactions did not really change my point of view, since my collegues seemed to agree with my categorization for my project as according to the different branches. What they did highlight however, was the difference in between a theoretical and actual evaluation. While I was evaluating the potentialities of my project, my colleagues invited me to look it as it was, an initial prototype. Friday Session 3 - Value Presentation \u00b6 Learning Skills: This session my group focused on the value of curiosity. Nonethless I was able to learn a lot from every presentation, as well as from my group\u2019s collaborative brainstorming. Collaboration: - \u201cCapacity for collaboration\u201d - is it meaningful collaboration? - Some people dont have the skills to collaborate because they were never given the chance to. - Collaboration is dependant on power roles and position of priviledge. - \u201cHow do you even measure that or think about that?\u201d - It is about creating safe environments for people to share. - Our biases also play a role in the means by which we collaborate. We must ask ourselves how can we collaborate without preconceptions and prior assumptions on both the project, our positionalities as collaborators, and our impacts on ecosystems. (Social) Justice: - When you are on top of the hierarchy, you do not see the need for justice. It is thus driven by the opressed, in most cases. - Reparation, accountability, distribution of power. - On a smaller scale, how can we define fairness and justice? This seems to be dependant on the futures that we hope to build for ourselves and others. - Justice many times lies in the way that we take things for granted. We feel unjusticed when things are taken away from us. - Justice is a \u201chuman concept\u201d. What does justice mean outside of human structures? - \u201cJustice is what love looks like in a public sphere\u201d -> relationship between humanity and society Curiosity: Our one hour conversation on curiosity involved so many different aspcets, that I think outlining it is a very difficult task. Yet, we came to the conclusion that curiosity is involves in our inherent beings, as methodologies for existensialism, yet also as a bridge for subsequent values such as collaboration, inclusivity, chaos, the power of listening, and so many more. One method that we found to instigue curiosity, was to encourage everyone in class to collectively engage in a fun exercise. The game challenges participants to explore different ideas, engage with the unknown, and continuously question the unfolding narrative: Incomplete information: As players are only aware of the word they themselves contribute, they must embrace the unknown and anticipate the potential combinations that could arise from the hidden words. This incomplete information piques curiosity and encourages participants to continuously wonder about the unfolding story. Desire to discover: With each turn, players are motivated to find out what the other participants have written. This desire to discover fuels curiosity, as players eagerly await the final reveal and the chance to piece together the entire narrative. Adaptive thinking: Since the game requires participants to work with the contributions of others, players must adapt their thinking and consider a range of possible scenarios. This encourages them to ask questions and make connections, stimulating their curiosity and cognitive flexibility. Unpredictable outcomes: The game\u2019s inherent unpredictability is a major source of curiosity. Participants can never be sure how their words will interact with others\u2019, creating a sense of suspense and excitement as the story unfolds. Interpersonal curiosity: The name-verb-adverb game also promotes curiosity about the other players, as individuals learn about each other\u2019s thought processes, sense of humor, and creative tendencies through their word choices. Exploration of language: The game serves as an opportunity for participants to explore the flexibility and richness of language. Players are encouraged to delve into the vast possibilities of words and expressions, generating a curiosity about the different ways they can be combined to create meaning. The game\u2019s structure and collaborative nature was a fun way we found to stimulate curiosity and invite our class to actively engage with the value. Dynamics The dynamic was really fun and mind-opening. I really enjoyed the way that everygroup established a different format to present their values, and how everyone was exited to both comment and listen on every presentation. I also really appreciated working outside of the classroom, under the sunlight. Interactions The interaction that stood out to me the most was the portrait ice breaker. I found it very interesting how are drawing styles were drawn from our personal cultures, and how I felt in a very delicate position when picturing the figure of somewhat else. The exercise made me realize how there is great power in the act of representation.","title":"Distributed Design"},{"location":"term3/17-DistributedDesign/#distributed-design","text":"","title":"Distributed Design"},{"location":"term3/17-DistributedDesign/#thursday-session-2-reflection-tree","text":"Learning Skills: This session highlighted the points of emphasis in my intervention: tapping into ecosystemic values, and also its points of weakness: environmental regeneration.

While at first the \u2018value\u2019 section it seemed common-sensical to me, as I began to question its relationship to infrastructures Interactions: Very honestly my interactions did not really change my point of view, since my collegues seemed to agree with my categorization for my project as according to the different branches. What they did highlight however, was the difference in between a theoretical and actual evaluation. While I was evaluating the potentialities of my project, my colleagues invited me to look it as it was, an initial prototype.","title":"Thursday Session 2 - Reflection Tree"},{"location":"term3/17-DistributedDesign/#friday-session-3-value-presentation","text":"Learning Skills: This session my group focused on the value of curiosity. Nonethless I was able to learn a lot from every presentation, as well as from my group\u2019s collaborative brainstorming. Collaboration: - \u201cCapacity for collaboration\u201d - is it meaningful collaboration? - Some people dont have the skills to collaborate because they were never given the chance to. - Collaboration is dependant on power roles and position of priviledge. - \u201cHow do you even measure that or think about that?\u201d - It is about creating safe environments for people to share. - Our biases also play a role in the means by which we collaborate. We must ask ourselves how can we collaborate without preconceptions and prior assumptions on both the project, our positionalities as collaborators, and our impacts on ecosystems. (Social) Justice: - When you are on top of the hierarchy, you do not see the need for justice. It is thus driven by the opressed, in most cases. - Reparation, accountability, distribution of power. - On a smaller scale, how can we define fairness and justice? This seems to be dependant on the futures that we hope to build for ourselves and others. - Justice many times lies in the way that we take things for granted. We feel unjusticed when things are taken away from us. - Justice is a \u201chuman concept\u201d. What does justice mean outside of human structures? - \u201cJustice is what love looks like in a public sphere\u201d -> relationship between humanity and society Curiosity: Our one hour conversation on curiosity involved so many different aspcets, that I think outlining it is a very difficult task. Yet, we came to the conclusion that curiosity is involves in our inherent beings, as methodologies for existensialism, yet also as a bridge for subsequent values such as collaboration, inclusivity, chaos, the power of listening, and so many more. One method that we found to instigue curiosity, was to encourage everyone in class to collectively engage in a fun exercise. The game challenges participants to explore different ideas, engage with the unknown, and continuously question the unfolding narrative: Incomplete information: As players are only aware of the word they themselves contribute, they must embrace the unknown and anticipate the potential combinations that could arise from the hidden words. This incomplete information piques curiosity and encourages participants to continuously wonder about the unfolding story. Desire to discover: With each turn, players are motivated to find out what the other participants have written. This desire to discover fuels curiosity, as players eagerly await the final reveal and the chance to piece together the entire narrative. Adaptive thinking: Since the game requires participants to work with the contributions of others, players must adapt their thinking and consider a range of possible scenarios. This encourages them to ask questions and make connections, stimulating their curiosity and cognitive flexibility. Unpredictable outcomes: The game\u2019s inherent unpredictability is a major source of curiosity. Participants can never be sure how their words will interact with others\u2019, creating a sense of suspense and excitement as the story unfolds. Interpersonal curiosity: The name-verb-adverb game also promotes curiosity about the other players, as individuals learn about each other\u2019s thought processes, sense of humor, and creative tendencies through their word choices. Exploration of language: The game serves as an opportunity for participants to explore the flexibility and richness of language. Players are encouraged to delve into the vast possibilities of words and expressions, generating a curiosity about the different ways they can be combined to create meaning. The game\u2019s structure and collaborative nature was a fun way we found to stimulate curiosity and invite our class to actively engage with the value. Dynamics The dynamic was really fun and mind-opening. I really enjoyed the way that everygroup established a different format to present their values, and how everyone was exited to both comment and listen on every presentation. I also really appreciated working outside of the classroom, under the sunlight. Interactions The interaction that stood out to me the most was the portrait ice breaker. I found it very interesting how are drawing styles were drawn from our personal cultures, and how I felt in a very delicate position when picturing the figure of somewhat else. The exercise made me realize how there is great power in the act of representation.","title":"Friday Session 3 - Value Presentation"},{"location":"term3/18-Prototyping2/","text":"Prototyping for Design 2.0 \u00b6 Robots \u00b6 Task: Create a file! This class, we were taught both the theory and practical apsect of using a robot. The robot moves on 7 different dimensions, which can be counted by its amount of joints. Later, we were also asked to prepare the robot file. We were provided with example files to understand how to set the robot parameters: It was really fun to play around with the robot. It was also intersting moving in the different dimensions in physical space, since I am used to modelling in virtual spaces, where you can move your viewport as acoording to the axis. Intro to Blender \u00b6 In this class Victor introduced us to his motives behind using Blender as a tool. Besides explaining the history of Blender, and how it came to be in 2004, Victor provided a very interesting reflective note on the use of softwares, motives and limitations. He explained how the tools we choose force us towards determined paths. We are thus dependant on that which is available to us within these coices. Yet, why do the designers of a tool chose the tools they provide? Obviously, this is dependent on the motivation of the designer, and in most cases, such a motivation is capital oriented.

These goals are then tied to moral meaning -making of social structures. On another hand, technologies was defined as \u201cpractical implementations of intelligence\u201d. At first I was skeptical about such as a definition. In my opinion, this depends on the definitions of practicality, and also for whom. What is practical to one, might be very complex to someone else. The definition of intelligence (as according to google) is \u201cthe ability to acquire and apply knowledge and skills\u201d. Yet, I do believe that not all technologies are practical aplications of knowledge. I believe that in many cases problems are created and incentivized to distort ones understanding of practicality, which in turn encourages the consumptions of such technologies. I later asked a question about it, and Ariel explained how he meant practical in the sense of objective, not convenient. Nonetheless, I liked how Ariel put it: \u201cTechnologies creates lots of problems, which create new technologies to fix them\u201d. This is a very important reflection for deigners, and the idea of neutrality. \u201cBecause of their active role in the codefinition of contexts, technologies have a clear moral dimension\u201d In this section of the class we discussed technologies as extensions of the human body in both a physical and psychological sense. Multi-stability: No technology is just one thing. This is a very interesting concept, and highlights the emotional context that we place onto technologies. It highlights the Technosolutionism: Baby video -//- Nassim Parvim, Just Design: Pasts, Presents, and Futures (Suggested reading) Parvim\u2019s piece offers valuable insight into the relationship between communication, technology, and socio-technical infrastructures. The text sheds light on how technological neutrality and technological determinism play crucial roles in shaping our collective futures. Technological neutrality asserts that technology is inherently neutral and only takes on ethical significance through human use. However, this perspective may prevent designers from considering the potential consequences of their work, resulting in the perpetuation of unjust social systems. In contrast, technological determinism assumes that technology drives social change, emphasizing the importance of responsible design choices. By recognizing the agency of designers, this perspective allows us to imagine technologies that can foster equitable futures. However, it is important to consider the possibility that technologies, while potentially contributing to equitable futures, may also create problems that incentivize the development of even more technologies, which could be unsustainable. This perpetual cycle of problem-solving may undermine efforts to create just and sustainable societies. As designers, it is crucial to be mindful of this paradox and work towards designing not just for immediate problem-solving, but for long-term social equity and environmental sustainability. Session 2: Laura Ben\u00edtez Valero \u00b6 This lecture was very interesting, making me question most prominently the hierarchical structures that we live in, and their relationships with references to illusory \u201cpurity-driven\u201d ideologies. Laura spoke of the two dimensions of power as according to Spinoza: a) Potestas, the negative and oppressive, and b) Potentia, the positive and empowering. Having studies communication, I tend to have a hard time accepting definitions. The presented definition made me question whether they fluctuate in relation to society itself, but also in reference to an individual. Here, we have to closely examine who use being empowered and who is being oppressed, considering the empowerment of one may in one way or another be seen as the oppression of another. I found the performance by Daniel Ortiz very powerful. The way she described how her new-born child would enter this world as an immigrant made me reflect on what sort of structure of communication this child would inherent from the nuicance of being born in another country. While I am from Brazil, and I am currently struggling to find means to continue in Barcelona after my studies since I do not have a \u201cpreferable visa\u201d, I was nonetheless born and raised in a country where I have privilege. This means that, while I do see inherent traits belonging to the explicitly sexist institutions of the Brazilian culture, and in many times a detachment from my ownership of my female body, I have never felt a detachment from the places which I transited. The performance was very mind-opening as Ortiz explicitly drew Spanish blood into her own body to free her child from restrictions and inherent traits of the non-belonging. It played on the right to be. Having said that, I think this also adds to our class discussion on the controversial statement \u201cI would not wish an identity upon anyone\u201d. Those who have the power to claim that, I believe, have never been restricted from their identities. In Ortiz\u2019s child\u2019s case for example, they will be stripped of their right to choose an identity from birth, and rather defined as the \u201cimmigrant\u201d. Now, we question epistemic violence. When we speak of epistemology thus knowledge production, we must question who are those responsible for shaping knowledge?

Our shared passions for mental and physical well-being, combined with a holistic perspective on wellness, ignited a captivating conversation that opened our eyes to the wisdom our bodies hold. Motivated by this newfound realization, we dared to dream big and set out to create something extraordinary\u2014a biofeedback device that could help us decode the intricate language of our nervous systems. Our mission was simple yet ambitious: to empower individuals with the tools to enhance their well-being by understanding and responding to the signals their bodies constantly send. Imagine if we could visualize the expressions of our nervous systems, decode their messages, and use that knowledge to shape our physical and mental states. With this vision in mind, we set out to build a model that would bring to life the concept of Heart Rate Variability (HRV)\u2014the fluctuations in the time intervals between our heartbeats. These fluctuations are a reflection of the delicate balance or imbalance within our nervous systems. Our goal was clear\u2014to create a real-time visualization of HRV and enable individuals to achieve balance and harmony within themselves. To achieve this, we collected heart rate data using ECG sensors, calculated HRV values, and transformed this information into interactive and engaging visualizations. We wanted to guide users in understanding their own bodily states, empowering them to navigate towards states that bring them greater well-being. HRV analysis, at its core, provides valuable insights into an individual\u2019s physiological state, their autonomic nervous system functioning, stress levels, and overall health. It has found applications in medical and research settings, sports science, and other domains where objective measurements and data-driven analysis hold great significance. But why do we believe in this approach so strongly? Our ultimate goal is to find equilibrium and embrace the flow of life. To achieve this, we must honor our bodies\u2019 innate wisdom and attentively respond to the signals they send us. We propose embracing biohacking techniques that optimize our nervous systems, focusing on cultivating relaxation rather than staying in a constant state of high alertness. This shift in mindset can significantly enhance our overall well-being. Resonance frequency breathing, an effective method we advocate, allows us to find this balance. By harmonizing our breath with our heart rate, we enter a state known as coherence\u2014a state that amplifies HRV and paves the way towards the desired equilibrium and flow. Through the application of this biofeedback technique, we can make more informed decisions about our well-being. While HRV data analysis traditionally revolves around algorithmic measurements, we believe there\u2019s more to explore. We strive to integrate HRV analysis with visual art, aiming for a more comprehensive, accessible, and holistic understanding of an individual\u2019s emotional and empathetic state.
