Drexciya was an electronic music duo composed by James Stinson and Gerald Donald, musicians that digitally synthesized futuristic-sounding music in response to Detroit\u2019s post-industrial gloomy environment of the early 80s. Trying to move away from the common narrative of suffering, present in racially-stigmatized genres such as rap and R&B, the duo produced music that envisioned a radically different scenario for black people in America. Their music thus narrates the adventures of the Drexciya tribes, which ruled both space and underwater environments. While I do not belong to a racial minority, Afrofuturism was the closest thing I found to represent my desire to embody and resignify socio-cultural emerging digital movements. My fight is a desire to recreate and innovate our hopes for the future. Like the Drexciyan duo, I am not satisfied with the popular narrative that our society is at a destructive point of no return. What I believe, is that we have to restructure our systems of knowledge and institutional practices in order to create a somewhat positive narrative for future generations.

By looking into the niche market of sneaker production and distribution, I hoped to dig into the specifics of supply chains, fabrication methodologies, and consumer cycles in order to understand how could I develop an innovative sustainable product within this market. When choosing a personal \u201cfight\u201d, I related to Afrofuturism and its technological reinvention of present futures. This involves asking the question of how one understands current socio-cultural paradigms in order to create new ones. My Design Space thus seeks to understand how can we use human-machine creative collaborations, such as in digital fabrication, biomaterials, and 3D printing to create a sustainable product which pushes towards sustainable and conscious consumerism as a norm. With a background and interest in 3D modeling, I began this design space with a product in mind: 3D-printed shoes. As a consequence, I picked material development, supply chain innovation, design for social innovation, and digital fabrication as my areas of opportunity. My superficial idea was to use sustainable and locally-sourced materials such as recycled and bio-materials to digitally fabricate shoes using 3D printing. Yet, as I began to ask questions, I realized such a project has a lifetime of implications such as, what would happen to outsourced production economic systems if localized production became the norm? To what extent do \u201cnew products\u201d, regardless of their sustainable practices, only feed into a culture of incessant consumerism and obsolescence? On that note, I then began to think about a digital line of products such as NFTs. Yet this also rose questions such as: what are the environmental effects of consuming in the metaverse? What about digital marginalization? As I began to dig deeper into the markets of fast fashion, circular economies, and climate consciousness in relation to material fabrication and distribution, I realized that these are complex networks with endless room for inquiry. Overall, as I find myself in a position of ignorance, I realize it becomes increasingly hard to genuinely speak of my design space as a space for affirmations. It has thus become a place for me to wonder. At its last stages, as I asked advice from a staff member at FabLab Bcn, she simply responded \u201cI think 3d printed shoes are sort of ridiculous. There really isn\u2019t anything new here, you are just using technologies to keep everything as it is\u201d. That is when I realized that I still have much to learn and speculate, in order to transform my design space into a realm of tangible action. My design space thus seeks to provide for open-ended inquiries into fields of innovation within fashion systems; most specifically, the elaboration of footwear. Trying to stick to my \u201cinitial fight\u201d, I am thus trying to understand how I can resignify current consumerism standards in order to strive towards sustainable production and conscious consumption of shoes.","title":"AoWS"},{"location":"term1/02-Atlas%20of%20Weak%20Signals/#atlas-of-weak-signals","text":"","title":"Atlas of Weak Signals"},{"location":"term1/02-Atlas%20of%20Weak%20Signals/#my-design-space","text":"My Design space seeks to bridge the gap between two weak signals: Climate consciousness and human-machine creative collaborations.

By evaluating a website prototype for an upcoming multidisciplinary arts platform, we attempted to perform design research so as to understand whether the website was intutitive, ecologically valid, and empathetic towards its target users and their digital agendas. In such example, I believed to be using prototyping as a means for inquiry, where analysis was based on user interviews and usability reviews. Here, we attempted to record user data so as to measure phenomena such as empathy probes, intuitive cues and user retention. Which ones you haven\u2019t use and how do you think they could be interesting for you? In contrast, my project might make use of research archetypes.
