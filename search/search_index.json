Drexciya was an electronic music duo composed by James Stinson and Gerald Donald, musicians that digitally synthesized futuristic-sounding music in response to Detroit\u2019s post-industrial gloomy environment of the early 80s. Trying to move away from the common narrative of suffering, present in racially-stigmatized genres such as rap and R&B, the duo produced music that envisioned a radically different scenario for black people in America. Their music thus narrates the adventures of the Drexciya tribes, which ruled both space and underwater environments. While I do not belong to a racial minority, Afrofuturism was the closest thing I found to represent my desire to embody and resignify socio-cultural emerging digital movements. My fight is a desire to recreate and innovate our hopes for the future. Like the Drexciyan duo, I am not satisfied with the popular narrative that our society is at a destructive point of no return. What I believe, is that we have to restructure our systems of knowledge and institutional practices in order to create a somewhat positive narrative for future generations.

By looking into the niche market of sneaker production and distribution, I hoped to dig into the specifics of supply chains, fabrication methodologies, and consumer cycles in order to understand how could I develop an innovative sustainable product within this market. When choosing a personal \u201cfight\u201d, I related to Afrofuturism and its technological reinvention of present futures. This involves asking the question of how one understands current socio-cultural paradigms in order to create new ones. My Design Space thus seeks to understand how can we use human-machine creative collaborations, such as in digital fabrication, biomaterials, and 3D printing to create a sustainable product which pushes towards sustainable and conscious consumerism as a norm. With a background and interest in 3D modeling, I began this design space with a product in mind: 3D-printed shoes. As a consequence, I picked material development, supply chain innovation, design for social innovation, and digital fabrication as my areas of opportunity. My superficial idea was to use sustainable and locally-sourced materials such as recycled and bio-materials to digitally fabricate shoes using 3D printing. Yet, as I began to ask questions, I realized such a project has a lifetime of implications such as, what would happen to outsourced production economic systems if localized production became the norm? To what extent do \u201cnew products\u201d, regardless of their sustainable practices, only feed into a culture of incessant consumerism and obsolescence? On that note, I then began to think about a digital line of products such as NFTs. Yet this also rose questions such as: what are the environmental effects of consuming in the metaverse? What about digital marginalization? As I began to dig deeper into the markets of fast fashion, circular economies, and climate consciousness in relation to material fabrication and distribution, I realized that these are complex networks with endless room for inquiry. Overall, as I find myself in a position of ignorance, I realize it becomes increasingly hard to genuinely speak of my design space as a space for affirmations. It has thus become a place for me to wonder. At its last stages, as I asked advice from a staff member at FabLab Bcn, she simply responded \u201cI think 3d printed shoes are sort of ridiculous. There really isn\u2019t anything new here, you are just using technologies to keep everything as it is\u201d. That is when I realized that I still have much to learn and speculate, in order to transform my design space into a realm of tangible action. My design space thus seeks to provide for open-ended inquiries into fields of innovation within fashion systems; most specifically, the elaboration of footwear.

In an attempt to deepen my understanding of brand identities and emotional materialism, my intervention involved the act of purchasing and dressing a garment virtually. I wanted to understand both the feasibility and emotional repercussions of trying on clothing digitally. This served as an experiment to reflect on the context of \u201cmetaverse\u201d identities and digital embodiment. I also wanted to depict what it would feel like to try clothing virtually for physical purchases, speculating about the idea of distribution in accordance with demand, versus the current paradigm of demand based on supply. This matters because we are undoubtedly riding a wave toward digital materialism, and it is important to break down what that means for future societies and how we can dive into this transition as sustainably as possible. What happens when you involve yourself? What I realized, is that when you involve yourself in an experiment taking a first person perspective, you move beyond the speculative. The experience that one will acquire from an autoethnography is personal, yet nonetheless valid. It created questions that I probably would not have asked if I had looked at the issue through an observer perspective. Did anything change about the way you were working? Yes, everything. In the first place, I realized how much this project was related to aesthetics over anything else. For example, my initial idea was to digitally fabricate the North Face jacket. After a few hours of work, and not much improvement, I decided to use the ready-made .obj file on my avatar render. I\u2019ve wanted a warm puffer jacket for a while, and it might have made sense to own one virtually. That\u2019s when I realized I actually wanted the product for its physical components: warmth. While the experience of dressing anything was in fact intriguing, I missed the tactile features of trying out tangible materials, where I take into account touch and weight. In order to understand to a deeper extent what that meant, I decided to download another garment; a Balenciaga-inspired blazer. I actually enjoyed virtually dressing this garment more than the first one. I thought it looked aesthetic; I wanted to play with it and make my own version of it. This also made me reflect on brand identities and how virtual fashion experiences reflect high-end fashion consumerism in the sense that they are both deeply related to aesthetics. In this case, it seems that how one feels depends on how one looks, and not in fact on the materials involved. I then wonder, what might this mean for VR acquisitions? Can we in fact use virtual components to aid tangible distribution practices? Would it be an effective consumer experience?","title":"Living w/ Your Own Ideas"},{"location":"term1/05-LivingWithIdeas/#living-with-your-own-ideas","text":"","title":"Living With Your Own Ideas"},{"location":"term1/05-LivingWithIdeas/#reflection-1st-person-intervention-on-virtual-fashion-systems","text":"What did you make and why did it matter?
