Maintaining the common theme of sustainability, both Nuria and Johnathan spoke of matters involving circular biological systems, DIY experiments, and self-sufficient agro practices which all converged to highlight the subject of what Jonathan described as \u201cmeta-design\u201d, thus the system within systems. This week\u2019s intellectual and practical exercises thus brought within themselves the insistence of rethinking current systems and using action as a vehicle for change. When I began this week\u2019s reflection, Interested in the practical experiment of developing bioplastics, alongside the genetic modification of microorganisms and our visit to the MATERFAD, I first looked into articles pertaining to \u2018plastic-eating\u2019 organisms as a vehicle for decomposing waste. That\u2019s when I ran into the Forbes article \u2018The race to develop plastic-eating bacteria\u2019 by Scott Carpenter. The article spoke of bacteria that are able to biodegrade PET plastic. Yet, \u201cIn order to make any of these naturally-occurring bacteria useful\u201d, meaning they would break down significant amounts of PET material, \u201cthey must be bioengineered to degrade plastic hundreds or thousands of times faster\u201d. This is explained to have ethical concerns related to the genetic modification of naturally-occurring beings, and also potentially hazardous effects for microbiomes in general. Nonetheless, the overarching issue is that even with such biotechnologies, these processes of biodegrading waste would not matter if societies are unable to properly recycle material, and differentiate our waste between recyclable and non-recyclable plastics. On a different note, Jonathan referred to Fukuoka\u2019s \u201cone-staw revolution\u201d when speaking of agricultural self-sufficiency and maintenance practices. According to \u2018The Philosophy of Masanobu Fukuoka\u2019, an article published by the Permaculture News, Fukuoka preaches against active intervention in biological rhythms. According to the article, \u201cRather than attempting to solve \u2018problems\u2019 through actions \u2013 new interventions to \u2018fix\u2019 things \u2013 he began to adopt a more \u2018subtractive\u2019 approach\u201d. In this case, he sought to substitute action for inaction. Yet, to what extent is that an optimal solution for the degradation of toxic waste? Rob from MATFAD spoke of mushroom species that have evolved towards \u201cplastic bioremediation properties\u201d. Hereby we can see how it is important to diverge from the common deceiving narrative of sustainable practices, and no \u201cone size fits all\u201d measure to our ever-growing rate of consumption and consequential waste production.","title":"Bio & Agri Zero"},{"location":"term1/05-LivingWithIdeas/","text":"Living With Your Own Ideas \u00b6 1 st Person Intervention on Virtual Fashion Systems \u00b6 What did you make and why did it matter? In an attempt to deepen my understanding of brand identities and emotional materialism, my intervention involved the act of purchasing and dressing a garment virtually. I wanted to understand both the feasibility and emotional repercussions of trying on clothing digitally. This served as an experiment to reflect on the context of \u201cmetaverse\u201d identities and digital embodiment. I also wanted to depict what it would feel like to try clothing virtually for physical purchases, speculating about the idea of distribution in accordance with demand, versus the current paradigm of demand based on supply. This matters because we are undoubtedly riding a wave toward digital materialism, and it is important to break down what that means for future societies and how we can dive into this transition as sustainably as possible. What happens when you involve yourself? What I realized, is that when you involve yourself in an experiment taking a first person perspective, you move beyond the speculative. The experience that one will acquire from an autoethnography is personal, yet nonetheless valid. It created questions that I probably would not have asked if I had looked at the issue through an observer perspective. Did anything change about the way you were working? Yes, everything. In the first place, I realized how much this project was related to aesthetics over anything else. For example, my initial idea was to digitally fabricate the North Face jacket. After a few hours of work, and not much improvement, I decided to use the ready-made .obj file on my avatar render. I\u2019ve wanted a warm puffer jacket for a while, and it might have made sense to own one virtually. That\u2019s when I realized I actually wanted the product for its physical components: warmth. While the experience of dressing anything was in fact intriguing, I missed the tactile features of trying out tangible materials, where I take into account touch and weight. In order to understand to a deeper extent what that meant, I decided to download another garment; a Balenciaga-inspired blazer. I actually enjoyed virtually dressing this garment more than the first one. I thought it looked aesthetic; I wanted to play with it and make my own version of it. This also made me reflect on brand identities and how virtual fashion experiences reflect high-end fashion consumerism in the sense that they are both deeply related to aesthetics. In this case, it seems that how one feels depends on how one looks, and not in fact on the materials involved. I then wonder, what might this mean for VR acquisitions?

I have never had any experience with hands on machine engineering, meaning that prototyping a \u201calmost useless machine\u201d was very challenging in the sense that I had to adopt a learn-as-you-go methodology. With very little experience in coding, and an academic notion of design, it was imperative that I let go of determined hopes for the final product, trying to guide the machine and its functionaliites rather than set a finite and absolute expectation for what it could and would do. This shift in way of designing was a challenge at both a personal and group level. This is because all of our members had different expectations according to their personal skills sets, be it mechanical engineering, coding, design or project management. Nonetheless, the obstacles we encountered along the way were themselves lessons which redesigned our critical design processes. Accomplishments Our final prototype turned out very different than our initial proposal, yet through experimentation with Arduino and our machinery, we believe to have come up with something more creative and interactive than expected. We were able to collaborate and reiterate on new ideas whenever we encountered drawbacks with our prototype. Every obstacle, as frustrating as they were, guided us towards a different way of designing.

Failures/Challenges What hindered our project, none-the-less, was our stubbornness related to our traditional conception of design. We tended to become frustrated when some things wouldn\u2019t function as according to plan, and also misinterpreted a few glitches along the way, blaming our code for what were actually mechanical issues. Also, we came to realize how choices related to aesthetics hindered the mechanical and objective funtionalitites of our prototype. Sometimes it was hard to let go of certain expectations for the prototype, which I believe to have been our greatest challenge. Nonetheless, the process of frustration, alongside aid from our colleagues and staff, forced us to continuously think outside the box to achieve a working prototype.

Personally, I believe things are getting worse, following an entropic nature of things. Nonetheless, I also believe that we should act to \u201cavert disasters\u201d. The community engagement lecture series was very intriguing, and I really appreciated the large number of references referred to when speaking of design. Design sometimes can seem like a somewhat abstract process, with an endless rabbit hole of questions. Nonetheless, the seminar demonstrated how small-scale community engagement is just as important when thinking about design. I specifically appreciated the topic \u201cframing complex systems by behavior structures\u201d, where we spoke about being over-resourced, meaning we can choose to funnel by elimination or layer by assimilation. I am personally interested in digital systems and bio-algorithmic tools, such as \u201cwearables\u201d and virtual reality digital experiences. Right now I find myself confused as to how to engage in an optimistic approach to digital tools, as I believe those to incur problems of accessibility, sustainability, and digital marginalization. The lecture then shifted my perspective, where maybe I could find small-scaled community solutions, layering by assimilation, rather than trying to wrap my head around a black-boxed system that seems to thrive on elimination. Overall, I enjoyed reflecting on current paradigms of power and social capital in terms of community engagement rather than large-scaled pessimism. Choosing a card \u00b6 When choosing community engagement terms, I chose silence. This is because I believe it is important to listen so as to learn. Especially when you are in a position of higher social capital, your voice and self-awareness may interefere with or silence someone else\u2019s voice. I believe community engagement to be an active practice of listening and absorbing information before taking action. Group Exercise \u00b6 Depicting causes for obesity in the UK in terms of design. Exercise - Creative Communities \u00b6 Creative Community Environmental Friendly Gardening Context \u201cThe Milieuvriendelijktuinieren project\u201d is a government-financed project which aims to encourage \u201cenvironmentally friendly\u201d gardens. This means they use insects instead of pesticides, decomposing plants as fertilizers, and thus opt for biologically natural instruments for gardening. This allows for respectful interaction with nature, and also the cultivation of healthier and sustainable food. Current situation Currently, the project continues to grow. Even though it is no longer a funded project, this community of slow gardeners seems is said to expand throughout the Netherlands, in various locations. This is an organic process, considering the project no longer holds an updated website. Engagement & Limits As ideal as natural gardening may be, it does hold a few limitations. Firstly, it must be considered that crop rotation is deemed essential for the health and maintanence of the soil, and one cycle may last as long as 6 years. Similarly, crops are aslo heavily dependent on weather condition. This means that natural gardening does not entitle one to freely choose the produce it wants to grow, rather, you would consume that which is available according to growing and climate seasons. For these reasons, alongside the time commitment and slow pace of natural gardening, it might be more convenient for one to buy readily-available produce. Another limitation may be the accessibility of information available for those who might me interested in natural gardening. Learning gardening is not an easy practice in itself, and natural gardening requires site-specific information (such as response to climate variations, local insects, etc) which may not be easily available to the wider public. Theory of change In order engage local communities in long-term transitions, we would require a theory of change. The inputs could include activities involving which would raise awareness on how to make use of existing waste leaves sweeping and food composting to feed your garden. Another example could provide community networks, maybe a community garden, where you could learn from and adapt in your own home. This could allow for reproduction of change. Design challenges and opportunities Considering the website is outdated, and the program\u2019s funding was cut in 2005, it might be difficult to advertise the program, its benefits, and related events. Nonetheless, considering the program has been growing regardlessly, we can assume that the community\u2019s interest in natural gardening is growing. This means there is an opportunity for a digital community, where knowledge on natural gardening tools and techniques could be better and further propagated via digital platforms. This could be done by updating the website with useful information for ammateur and non-professional gardeners, or by creating social media account networks, such as an Instagram page, where gardeners can share their crops, ask questions, and feel like part of a greater community. A digital collective platform could also share information on community workshops and youtube video tutorials. Even though word of mouth has been a valid and powerful tool in the advertising of natural gardening communities, a digital community would be more accessible, and might provide deeper insights for the widespread natural gardening communities across the world.","title":"Community Engagement"},{"location":"term1/07-CommunityEngagement/#community-engagement","text":"","title":"Community Engagement"},{"location":"term1/07-CommunityEngagement/#reflection","text":"When thinking of Polak\u2019s game (Hayward & Candy 2017), I find myself in the Lower Right corner. Personally, I believe things are getting worse, following an entropic nature of things. Nonetheless, I also believe that we should act to \u201cavert disasters\u201d. The community engagement lecture series was very intriguing, and I really appreciated the large number of references referred to when speaking of design. Design sometimes can seem like a somewhat abstract process, with an endless rabbit hole of questions. Nonetheless, the seminar demonstrated how small-scale community engagement is just as important when thinking about design. I specifically appreciated the topic \u201cframing complex systems by behavior structures\u201d, where we spoke about being over-resourced, meaning we can choose to funnel by elimination or layer by assimilation. I am personally interested in digital systems and bio-algorithmic tools, such as \u201cwearables\u201d and virtual reality digital experiences. Right now I find myself confused as to how to engage in an optimistic approach to digital tools, as I believe those to incur problems of accessibility, sustainability, and digital marginalization. The lecture then shifted my perspective, where maybe I could find small-scaled community solutions, layering by assimilation, rather than trying to wrap my head around a black-boxed system that seems to thrive on elimination. Overall, I enjoyed reflecting on current paradigms of power and social capital in terms of community engagement rather than large-scaled pessimism.","title":"Reflection"},{"location":"term1/07-CommunityEngagement/#choosing-a-card","text":"When choosing community engagement terms, I chose silence. This is because I believe it is important to listen so as to learn.

This means they use insects instead of pesticides, decomposing plants as fertilizers, and thus opt for biologically natural instruments for gardening. This allows for respectful interaction with nature, and also the cultivation of healthier and sustainable food. Current situation Currently, the project continues to grow. Even though it is no longer a funded project, this community of slow gardeners seems is said to expand throughout the Netherlands, in various locations. This is an organic process, considering the project no longer holds an updated website. Engagement & Limits As ideal as natural gardening may be, it does hold a few limitations. Firstly, it must be considered that crop rotation is deemed essential for the health and maintanence of the soil, and one cycle may last as long as 6 years. Similarly, crops are aslo heavily dependent on weather condition. This means that natural gardening does not entitle one to freely choose the produce it wants to grow, rather, you would consume that which is available according to growing and climate seasons.
