## The Crystal Ball Machine - A Reflection on AI

### Reflection

What is intelligence? Can we measure creativity? These were the intial questions proposed at the begginig of the seminar Extended Intelligences. While I'm still unsure of the answer to these questions, when speaking of artificial intelligences, intelligence seems to a system which intakes inputs so as to produce outputs.

It was really helpful to put such perspective into practice when speculating on a future predicting crystal ball. Our project involved a crystal ball which would predict the future by taking our users' dreams as input A, and a question about their futures as input B. As absurd as such idea seemed to me in the early stages of the project, I soon came to realize how such an idea of interpreting and digitizing dreams has already been enacted by scientists.
