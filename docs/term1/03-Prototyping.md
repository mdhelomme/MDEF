# Prototyping

***4 main roles of prototyping:***
*The prototype as an experimental component
*The prototype as a means of inquiry
*The prototype as a research archetype
*The process of prototyping as a vehicle for inquiry

*Which ones have you used and for what purposes?*

*Which ones you havenâ€™t use and how do you think they could be interesting for you?*
