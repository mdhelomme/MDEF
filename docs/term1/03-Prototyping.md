# Prototyping

***4 main roles of prototyping:***

1. The prototype as an experimental component

2. The prototype as a means of inquiry

3. The prototype as a research archetype

4. The process of prototyping as a vehicle for inquiry


*Which ones have you used and for what purposes?*

The only form of prototyping which I have previous experience with are usability studies in UX Design processes. By evaluating a website prototype for an upcoming multidisciplinary arts platform, we attempted to perform design research so as to understand whether the website was intutitive, ecologically valid, and empathetic towards its target users and their digital agendas. In such example, I believed to be using prototyping as a means for inquiry, where analysis was based on user interviews and usability reviews. Here, we attempted to record user data so as to measure phenomena such as empathy probes, intuitive cues and user retention.

*Which ones you havenâ€™t use and how do you think they could be interesting for you?*

In contrast, my project might make use of research archetypes. Considering myself a visual being, I believe that I will urge to use visual illustrations and demonstrations of whatever product serves as my final project, in order to grasp a real-time analysis of potential product users.
