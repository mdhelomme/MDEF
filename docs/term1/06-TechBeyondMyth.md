### Personal Reflection - Learning by Accomplishments and Failures

Write a post out your weekly experience
Reflect your learning goals and possible applications of the technology learned
All the students have to document their work for the course:
Personal reflexions and learning outcome post (personal MDEF webpage)

Video at minimum 1080p stabilized (not hand held recordings, use a tripod if you don ́t know how to stabilize by software)
Black, gray, white or color (studio background).
Libre music matching the artifacts(properly acknowledged).
Ideally the sound produced by the machine will be also recorded in the video.
Entry and finish titles with Team names, name of the artifact and Iaac/FablabBCN.
