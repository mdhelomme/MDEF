Guillem was the guide for our initial foray into the universe of digital protocols and formats. His opening question to us was an intriguing one: "Upon hearing 'bitcoin', 'NFTs', 'blockchain', what is your immediate reaction?" While I am interested in the topic, my intial reaction was nonetheless skeptical, especially in terms of NFTs. 

Nevertheless, as our educational journey continued, I observed a transformation in my understanding of these novel technologies. If asked by Guillem now, I would describe these advancements as emerging conduits for commerce, developed by collective efforts to revamp the existing narratives and design protocols that align with the ever-evolving digital landscape.

Following this, we embarked on a deeper exploration of web3 and NFTs, featuring lively debates and hands-on activities. Among our initial undertakings was the creation of a virtual wallet, named 'TEMPLE'. We expanded our knowledge base with a study of TEZOS and took a step towards practical application by crafting and uploading a token image to OBJKT WEB. We even had the chance to engage in a simulated buying and selling exercise among ourselves.

It was during these activities that I began to reconcile with my initial skepticism, particularly surrounding NFTs. The hands-on experience of creating and interacting with these digital assets provided valuable insights into their real-world applications and potential benefits.
