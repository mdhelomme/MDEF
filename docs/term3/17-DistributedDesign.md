***Learning Skills:***

This session highlighted the points of emphasis in my intervention: tapping into ecosystemic values, and also its points of weakness: environmental regeneration. During the activity, I was required to examine both the actual status of my project and its potential status within each section. What I mean by this is that I had to evaluate how I weighed my project as according to my sense-making priorities, and also how I could potentially improve it as according to secondary objectives. In simpler words, it showed me what I had already accomplished and how could I move towards the next steps in direction of a positive impact.

***Dynamics:***

I really enjoyed my group's dynamics, particularly Korbi's reflections on the definitions of value and capital. To put it simply, he made us question whether there was really any distincition between the 'value' section of the tree, to the 'environmental' and 'social'. Values of exchange, in my opining, are in fact instrinsically tied to social-economic systems. While at first the 'value' section it seemed common-sensical to me, as I began to question its relationship to infrastructures

***Interactions:***

Very honestly my interactions did not really change my point of view, since my collegues seemed to agree with my categorization for my project as according to the different branches. What they did highlight however, was the difference in between a theoretical and actual evaluation. While I was evaluating the potentialities of my project, my colleagues invited me to look it as it was, an initial prototype.
