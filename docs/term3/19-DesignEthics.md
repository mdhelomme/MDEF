### Session 1: Ariel Guersensvaig

**A Reflection on the morality of technologies**

In this class, we talked about technology as a goal-oriented tool. These goals are then tied to moral meaning -making of social structures. On another hand, technologies was defined as "practical implementations of intelligence". At first I was skeptical about such as a definition. In my opinion, this depends on the definitions of practicality, and also for whom. What is practical to one, might be very complex to someone else. The definition of intelligence (as according to google) is "the ability to acquire and apply knowledge and skills". Yet, I do believe that not all technologies are practical aplications of knowledge. I believe that in many cases problems are created and incentivized to distort ones understanding of practicality, which in turn encourages the consumptions of such technologies. I later asked a question about it, and Ariel explained how he meant practical in the sense of objective, not convenient. Nonetheless, I liked how Ariel put it: "Technologies creates lots of problems, which create new technologies to fix them". This is a very important reflection for deigners, and the idea of neutrality.
