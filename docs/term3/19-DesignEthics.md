# Design Ethics

### Session 1: Ariel Guersensvaig

**A Reflection on the morality of technologies**

In this class, we talked about technology as a goal-oriented tool. These goals are then tied to moral meaning -making of social structures. On another hand, technologies was defined as "practical implementations of intelligence". At first I was skeptical about such as a definition. In my opinion, this depends on the definitions of practicality, and also for whom. What is practical to one, might be very complex to someone else. The definition of intelligence (as according to google) is "the ability to acquire and apply knowledge and skills". Yet, I do believe that not all technologies are practical aplications of knowledge. I believe that in many cases problems are created and incentivized to distort ones understanding of practicality, which in turn encourages the consumptions of such technologies. I later asked a question about it, and Ariel explained how he meant practical in the sense of objective, not convenient. Nonetheless, I liked how Ariel put it: "Technologies creates lots of problems, which create new technologies to fix them". This is a very important reflection for deigners, and the idea of neutrality.

"Because of their active role in the codefinition of contexts, technologies have a clear moral dimension".

Nassim Parvim, Just Design: Pasts, Presents, and Futures (Suggested reading)

Parvim's piece offers valuable insight into the relationship between communication, technology, and socio-technical infrastructures. The text sheds light on how technological neutrality and technological determinism play crucial roles in shaping our collective futures.

Technological neutrality asserts that technology is inherently neutral and only takes on ethical significance through human use. However, this perspective may prevent designers from considering the potential consequences of their work, resulting in the perpetuation of unjust social systems. In contrast, technological determinism assumes that technology drives social change, emphasizing the importance of responsible design choices. By recognizing the agency of designers, this perspective allows us to imagine technologies that can foster equitable futures.

However, it is important to consider the possibility that technologies, while potentially contributing to equitable futures, may also create problems that incentivize the development of even more technologies, which could be unsustainable. This perpetual cycle of problem-solving may undermine efforts to create just and sustainable societies. As designers, it is crucial to be mindful of this paradox and work towards designing not just for immediate problem-solving, but for long-term social equity and environmental sustainability.
