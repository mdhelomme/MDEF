# About

My name is Mariana, and while I hold a ‘professional’ background in marketing, I am interested in reinventing myself as a critical designer and three-dimensional enthusiast. Holding a Bachelor’s degree in communication studies, alongside a fixation on technological design and visual innovation, I have spent the last year independently studying 3D modeling and emergent digital trends. Having said that, I hope to restructure and expand my knowledge of communication design systems and digital fabrication through IAAC’s Master in Design for Emergent Futures.

Ultimately, I am interested in the emerging future because I am deeply intrigued by the development of cultural identities in the upcoming socio-technological environment. I want to understand why we live in a western narrative of digital fetishism, choosing to incessantly partake in digital communication networks. Also, I wish to explore how augmented and virtual realities play a role in this. Are these tools for accessibility or marginalization? Maybe both? To what extent have we turned into bio-algorithmic beings? How does this affect our relationships with our natural environments?

Ultimately, here you will find my exploration of three-dimensional virtual systems in relation to the tangible world, and what consequences such relationships cause to our communities.
