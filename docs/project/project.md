# Term 1 Reflection

##Personal Reflection

Term 1, personally, was very confusing. I feel like I should have had an improved system of communication, and that I did not immerse myself in collaborative systems. Of course, there were a few setbacks such as the adaptation to the city, and the course’s a very unusual structure. But these could have been dealt with to a greater extent if I had been more organized with my communication tools. Having said that, this term I am hoping to dive into a greater amount of projects, to expand my ideas, and also increase my opportunities for collaboration with local communities. I am also making sure to record everything that I do, whereas last term I lacked pictures and in-depth reflections. Having said that, here are the projects that I will be working on this following term:

###Potential Collaborative Interventions

**“Drugs? You Better Know”**

This is a project where we are exploring the information widely available to the public on illegal drugs. Trying to intervene with the drug-saturated social culture of Barcelona, Claudia and Myself are designing a campaign to inform the public on which drugs are best to mix, which are not, what are the recommended doses, etc. What we hope to do here, is to tap into the somewhat banal taboo of recreational substance usage.

**Kombucha leather/Fish skin leather**

This is a Project in its early stages, where Marielle and I are looking to develop sustainable leather-like materials from two Kombucha Scobys and Fish Skin. Leather has widespread ecological implications, from animal abuse to toxic leather tinting. In contrast, we are here looking into developing sustainable alternatives to the material, taking into consideration these two materials as cultural practices (Asian and indigenous).

**Athletics, Smart Fabrics & AR**

Dhriti and I are currently discussing if we should collaborate on a project involving athletic technologies. The project would focus on the interplay between AR, smart textiles, and wearable technologies to improve athletic performance.

**Mycelium and the collective consciousness of non-human beings**

Taking on a conceptual stance, Stella and I are looking into the idea of consciousness in non-human beings, such as Fungi. Touching on both spirituality and solar punk systems, we are hoping to dig deeper into the conscious networks of mycelium so at to gain an innovative perspective on human consciousness and interspecies collaborations.

**Augmented Creativity and methodologies for the non-human**

This collective intervention was completed last term. Here, we attempted to create a design methodology for altered states. We used sensory tools such as tea, breathwork, and guided haiku poetry, in an attempt to facilitate a transition into “non-human-like” states of consciousness. At the present moment, two methodology prototypes were performed, where we learned a lot about what it means to facilitate an experiment which taps into subject consciousness, and how to best record such results. As a group, we are still discussing whether we will continue to develop our experiment prototype.


###Personal Explorations

**AR & VR**

I spent my Christmas holidays learning how to code AR. I am still unsure of how I could use such technologies to its maximum potential, yet for now, I am interested in making alive that which is invisible. After reading “Futuros Ancestrais” by Ailton Krenak, I became intrigued by our notions of civil sanitation in the war against nature. My first experiment, then, is to create an AR experience that fills our environments with non-human biological beings, be those animals, trees, fungi, etc.

**Chitosan + Coffee Leather**

Here, as I was reading about biomaterials and their extents, I became particularly interested in Chitosan and Coffee leather and its aesthetics. I am then hoping to collaborate with Itnig for the coffee, and do some experimentation with the development of this material.
