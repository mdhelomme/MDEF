# Design Studio Term 2

This term, I completed three interventions. The first one was a prototype performed in class, the second was performed in the Design Dialogues, and the third one was a first-person perspective research on Artificial Intelligence and Software Development.

The first two interventions were built as a collective of continuous interventions surrounding the weak signal of recreational drug use. Our project was born out of a desire to make a difference in the subtle indications of recreational substances and their banalities. These substances have been a pervasive trend for some time, yet discussions surrounding them have remained surprisingly hushed. By approaching it as a weak signal, we aimed to stimulate and cultivate this speculative conversation using the resources provided by our academic environment at IAAC and Fab Lab Barcelona. While the project was only tested at the Design Dialogues, we did have prior plans to expose it at Mostra Festival, yet we were hindered by health issues that impeded us from attending the event. The project was also built in collaboration with FabLab since we submitted it for the Sonar +D open call on their behalf. Lastly, when looking for expert advice, we collaborated with Diego Suarez, a BAU Professor and Interaction Designer. Since the prototype encountered a series of obstacles along the way, it is difficult to claim whether they were meaningful for the external people involved. Nonetheless, they paved the way for a deeper understanding of the weak signals we were tapping into, such as the way in which we had to frame such subversive conversations. It also evidenced the obstacles of submitting prototype proposals to larger institutions.

In terms of finding and connecting spaces, infrastructure, people, and communities for a meaningful intervention, I believe we were reasonably successful. We utilized resources from our academic environment, including IAAC and Fab Lab Barcelona, and established collaborations with experts. Although our plans to present at the Mostra Festival were hindered, amongst other frustrating obstacles, we managed to adapt every step of the way and learn from each developmental stage.

The third intervention was a first-person-perspective research on app development and Chat GPT. By using artificial intelligence to build an app from scratch, with no prior knowledge of app development, I tapped into the weak signal of human-machine collaborations. It was an interesting intervention on a personal level, where I was continuously frustrated by the fact that I cannot code. This transformative experience shifted my perspective on the traditional programming process, and I believe that AI has the potential to revolutionize the app development landscape. The intervention then encouraged me to rethink traditional app development methods and the roles of humans and AI in the process.

While the intervention did not necessarily involve connecting various spaces, infrastructures, or communities, it showcased the power of AI to bridge gaps in individual skill sets, such as the inability to code. The intervention's success can be attributed to its potential for sparking discussions on the broader implications of AI in app development, thus effectively bringing global weak signals to local implementation. Nonetheless, I do believe that collaboration with a wider audience would have provided me with a more complex analysis of human-AI-Software relationships.
