## 09/01 Reflection on Audrey Desjardines' Talk:
### Autobiographical Design, Approaching Failure, Revealing Tensions in Autobiographical Design

During our session with Audrey Desjardines, we delved into the world of first-person design methods, exploring autobiographical design, autoethnography, and duo ethnography. Audrey recounted her unique experience of "Living in a Prototype," wherein she transformed a van into a functional living space, constantly updating and modifying it as she inhabited the space. This design process emphasized reciprocal shaping, growing individuality, and the perpetual state of incompletion. In autoethnography and first-person design, the emphasis lies in the journey and documentation of findings and adaptations, rather than the final product. The design constantly evolves and adapts, making it distinctive due to its alignment with one's personal needs and discoveries.

Key takeaways from the talk included the importance of committing to an enjoyable, simple documentation format and setting a specific, yet flexible timeframe. Audrey's documentation on Instructables not only showcased her design process but also fostered input from others with similar experiences or challenges. She also shared examples of documentation through reflection templates containing photographs and specific data, and a pre-made book called "Rep(air)" designed for users to fill out.

## 23/01 Reflection on Laura Forlano's Talk:
### Auto-ethnography - Living as a Disabled Cyborg

Laura Forlano discussed the intersection of interactive machines and the concept of cyborgs, highlighting Donna Haraway's feminist redefinition of the term cyborg in a positive light. Laura explored the role of machines in the care industry and how the online community can discuss medical issues and rare diseases. She raised the thought-provoking question, "Can AI be disabled?" This intriguing question sheds light on the myth of technological perfection and the biases present within it, while also addressing the ethical implications of AI and its potential exclusionary effects.

This talk inspired reflection on how designers can collaborate and employ data collection to enhance medical systems ethically and sustainably. The abundance of data and feedback from medical device users could provide real-time input for designers. However, implementing this information remains challenging, particularly in the heavily regulated medical field that varies across countries and organizations.

## 30/01 Reflection on Fred Van Amstel's Talk:
### Monster Aesthetics

Fred Van Amstel's talk highlighted the impact of colonization on our bodies, design as a field, and its connection to politics. The discussion emphasized the importance of acknowledging the relationship between design and politics and consistently questioning the role of our privileges and biases in design. Can designers work with communities, particularly minority or oppressed groups, in a way that does not perpetuate extraction or colonization? Fred spoke about the internal contradictions we face and the necessity to balance these opposing forces while being aware of our role and positionality in collaborations and interventions.

## 20/02 Reflection on Julia Ballesteros and Milena Rosés' Talk:
### Tierra de Arcillas

Julia and Milena shared their journey of discovering clay in their hometown of Íllar, La Alpujarra. Through questioning industrial ceramic production and engaging with locals, they learned how to source clay, conduct workshops, and find purpose in their craft. Their story emphasized the value of interaction with local communities and older generations who possess knowledge that might otherwise be disregarded. Meaningful and respectful co-creation necessitates inquiry and engagement with the surrounding community.
