**What surprised you this week?**
The world of mycelium was very interesting to me. I was surprised by the amount of different things that you can develop using mycelium, and the different structures it can take. I also appreciated to learn how Lara and Jess received funding for their determined projects, in order to raise S-biotica. 

**What can you utilize for your personal project?**
I am unsure of whether I would like to work with mycelium. While I find it very interesting, I think the process would be very time-consuming, given a lot of experiential learning would be required. Yet, I will expand my work done with Kombucha. I have always enjoyed the processes of growing Scobys and brewing kombucha, and I was fascinated by the garment experimentation done with Kombucha leather. Hereby, I will begin to experiment with the unconventional uses of Scobys.
