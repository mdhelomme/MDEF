### 01/02 - Electronics and Coding

This class we explored the basics and extents of electronics. Personally, as someone who has never worked with electronics, it was difficult to grasp the practical uses of the theoretical knowledge presented. Nonetheless, I am exited for future projects, where I hope to truly understand the extents of electronic hardware and command-based electronics.

Following, here is the class assignment: Arduino Code and Music.
