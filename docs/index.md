## Welcome

Hello! Welcome to my website. This is a digital space where I will share content such as assignments and reflections for my Masterâ€™s in Design for Emergent Futures. Here you will find a diverse series of reflections related to my classes at IAAC and Elisava, and also references to my explorations related to creative expression and sustainable virtual realms.

This website serves to reference my explorations both inside and outside of the classroom, and I hope you enjoy scrolling through my creative and critical journey.
